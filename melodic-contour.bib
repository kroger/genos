  title = {Contour Modeling by Multiple Linear Regression of the Nineteen Piano
	Sonatas by Mozart},
  school = {The Florida State University. School of Music},
  year = {2003},
  type = {PhD Diss.},
  abstract = {Theories of musical contour can be described as the study of the change
	in one musical parameter as a function of another. In my dissertation,
	contour theories proposed by Robert Morris, Michael Friedmann, Elizabeth
	Marvin, Paul Laprade, Ian Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky
	and Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these authors approach
	changes in pitch as a function of time. A commonality between these
	theories was shown to be the use of a system of pitch level identification
	based on the relative highness or lowness of the pitches, not based
	on actual pitch frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody. Additionally,
	these theories did not account for rhythmic or durational elements
	of the pitches as they are articulated in time. Music perception
	studies were cited that indicated that contour can play an important
	role in the recognition and memory of a melody, and that pitch interval
	and rhythmic components are vital elements in music understanding.
	Because these contour theories lacked the important musical elements
	of pitch and rhythm, an analytical method for the study of musical
	contour that incorporates both of these in its model of a melody
	is developed. This analytical method uses the mathematical technique
	of multiple linear regression to develop a model of the melody that
	can be graphed as representative of the contour of the actual melody.
	This method was used to analyze the first themes from the first movements
	of the nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using regression
	modeling, the sonata melodies were categorized into two melody types:
	Type MD and Type LB. Analytical methods proposed by other theorists
	were then used to analyze selected melodies, and a comparison between
	the multiple linear regression model and these results was made.},

@PHDTHESIS{clifford:contour,
  author = {Robert John Clifford},
  title = {Contour as a structural element in selected pre-serial works by Anton
	Webern},
  school = {University of Wisconsin-Madison},
  year = {1995},
  abstract = {Contour is a generalization of melodic direction (in particular, ascending
	and descending motion), but it is not routinely considered a primary
	delineator of structure in most tonal music. A melody in a common-practice
	work might leap to a high register and then suddenly reverse itself
	at a particularly crucial moment. Although this melody interacts
	with other musical events, one would probably interpret its contour
	as a contributor to--but not a primary delineator of--musical structure.
	But contour possesses an increased potential to create structural
	associations in post-tonal music (specifically atonal or motivic
	music), where the melodic and harmonic progressions of tonal music
	are absent. Contour relations are analyzed in a group of atonal works
	by Webern: Sechs Bagatellen, op. 9; Drei kleine Stücke, op. 11; the
	Fünf Orchesterstücke, op. 10; and the Orchesterstücke (1913). These
	works lack certain types of pitch organization, such as overt tonal
	references and 12-tone techniques, which often account for structural
	associations. In the absence of these systems of pitch organization,
	contour becomes a significiant structural factor on the melodic level
	and in larger expanses of music. The melodic properties most important
	to the formation of contour are identified. Selected contour definitions
	are reviewed. Four interpretive assumptions by which contour can
	be evaluated are proposed, and four analyses of contour relations
	in complete works (one movement from each opus) are discussed. Various
	associational and transformational relations between melodic contour,
	a medial level of structure labeled textural contour, and the contour
	of the entire piece are examined.},

  journal = {Music Theory Spectrum},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {xv},
  pages = {205--28},
  abstract = {The paper begins with a brief review of previous work on musical contour
	by Richard Bassein, Robert Cogan. Pozzi Escot, Michael Friedmann,
	Paul Laprade, Elizabeth Marvin. Robert Morris, Larry Polansky, and
	James Tenney. To this end. Schoenberg's Piano Piece, Op. 19 No. 4
	is analyzed. Its pc-set segmentations are associated with relations
	among sets of equivalent contours. The main part of the paper introduces
	the contour reduction algorithm, based on principles of perceptual
	organization from gestalt psychology. The algorithm allows one to
	associate nonadjacent contour pitches according to their degree of
	salience. Any contour can be reduced to one of a set of irreducible
	prime contours that defines its characteristit depth. The algorithm
	is applied to the six phrases of the Schoenberg piece and the result
	resonates well with the previous contouripc-set analysis. The hierarchic
	nature of the algorithm also helps organize the many classes of equivalent
	contours. Morris's definition of a contour as the association of
	any two sets leads to the construction of a taxonomy including all
	possible contours. Contours that include replication and simultaneities
	are defined by various categories in mathematical relation theory.
	The paper includes a discussion of the role of salience in musical
	structure. The contour reduction algorithm is compared to familiar
	reductive methodologies of tonal music and the perceptual gestalt
	theories of Tenney and Polansky.},

	"non-stylistic" approach is taken. Specific musical situations (like
	the equivalence classes generated by elementary transformations,

	are not invoked. Further generalization of the theory of the "number
	of possible contours" includes the formulation of a theory of contour
	for asymmetrical and non-ternary contour descriptions, one we believe
	to be of musical interest. We assume that contour may be applied
	to any parameter of music, at any hierarchical level. These ideas

	pitch means in some large-scale segmentation of a piece, or any other
	quantifiable parameter.},
