                  the pedagogical viability of computer-generated
                  melodic contour mapping systems in the classical
                  singing studio, as perceived by their resulting
                  effect (if any) on vocal timbre when a singer's head
                  and neck remained in a normal singing posture. The
                  evaluation of data gathered during the course of the
                  study indicates that the development of consistent
                  vocal timbre produced by the classical singing
                  student may be enhanced through visual/kinesthetic
                  response to melodic contour inversion mapping, as it
                  balances the singer's perception of melodic
                  intervals in standard musical
                  notation. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that the
                  system, in its natural melodic contour mode, may
                  also be useful for teaching a student to sing a
                  consistent legato line. The results of the study
                  also suggest that the continued development of this
                  new technology for the general teaching studio,
                  designed to address standard musical notation and a
                  singer's visual/kinesthetic response to it, may
                  indeed be useful.",

  abstract =     {Theories of musical contour can be described as the
                  study of the change in one musical parameter as a
                  function of another. In my dissertation, contour
                  theories proposed by Robert Morris, Michael
                  Friedmann, Elizabeth Marvin, Paul Laprade, Ian
                  Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky and
                  Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these
                  authors approach changes in pitch as a function of
                  time. A commonality between these theories was shown
                  to be the use of a system of pitch level
                  identification based on the relative highness or
                  lowness of the pitches, not based on actual pitch
                  frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody.
                  Additionally, these theories did not account for
                  rhythmic or durational elements of the pitches as
                  they are articulated in time. Music perception
                  studies were cited that indicated that contour can
                  play an important role in the recognition and memory
                  of a melody, and that pitch interval and rhythmic
                  components are vital elements in music
                  understanding. Because these contour theories lacked
                  the important musical elements of pitch and rhythm,
                  an analytical method for the study of musical
                  contour that incorporates both of these in its model
                  of a melody is developed. This analytical method
                  uses the mathematical technique of multiple linear
                  regression to develop a model of the melody that can
                  be graphed as representative of the contour of the
                  actual melody. This method was used to analyze the
                  first themes from the first movements of the
                  nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using
                  regression modeling, the sonata melodies were
                  categorized into two melody types: Type MD and Type
                  LB. Analytical methods proposed by other theorists
                  were then used to analyze selected melodies, and a
                  comparison between the multiple linear regression
                  model and these results was made.},

                  patterns and group theory. Benson provides a wealth

                  varying levels of technicality, the real interplay
                  between these two ancient disciplines.  The story is
                  long as well as broad and involves physics, biology,
                  psycho acoustics, the history of science, and
                  digital technology as well as, of course,
                  mathematics and music. Starting with the structure
                  of the human ear and its relationship with Fourier

                  musical instruments to the ideas of consonance and
                  dissonance, and then to scales and
                  temperaments. This is a must-have book if you want

                  Morris as a point of departure and develops a set of
                  contour reduction algorithms, called "window
                  algorithms." These involve the notion of a
                  hypothetical window or frame of a specific width
                  (i.e. number of events) through which the contour
                  succession in a given melody is experienced
                  temporally (much like the way a landscape is
                  experienced visually through the side window of a
                  moving automobile or train. Certain normative
                  principles relevant to windows of various widths are
                  devised and represented with the help of symbolic
                  logic and flowcharts. Reiterative application of the
                  window algorithms on a melody to "prune" pitches at
                  a series of successive levels, introduces notions of
                  melodic contour hierarchy that are explored in
                  various ways throughout the dissertation. The
                  application of the algorithms is demonstrated on a
                  variety of 20th century musical excerpts reflecting
                  a wide range of melodic archetypes, thereby enabling
                  observation of the behavior of the algorithms in
                  different musical contexts.  Phenomenological and
                  cognitive implications of the algorithms are
                  discussed from the perspective of a listener
                  implementing the algorithm on the fly. An analysis
                  focusing on the Hauptstimmen in the first movement
                  of Schoenberg’s Third String Quartet explores how
                  intervallic features of the reduced contours can
                  form the basis for a tonal-formal reading of the
                  movement. The possibility of extending the theory to
                  the duration domain is also introduced; following a
                  preliminary analysis involving instrumental gestures
                  from the opening of Webern’s Variations for
                  Orchestra, and a discussion of analytical,
                  conceptual, and methodological inconsistencies
                  arising from the application of the algorithms on
                  duration contours, an alternative approach that
                  attaches appropriate durations to (reduced) pitch
                  contours is developed, examined, and advocated. The
                  relationships and interactions between the pitch and
                  duration contours in Berio’s Sequenza I are examined
                  in the light of the proposed theory.},

                  Tutorial utilizando recursos de hipertexto para
                  vincular: 1) conceitos e definições da Teoria
                  Pós-tonal, 2) as operações do Processador de Classes
                  de Notas (PCN) do Dr.  Jamary Oliveira, e 3)
                  exercícios de composição. Essa integração permite ao
                  usuário transferir o conhecimento entre as duas
                  primeiras seções e aplicar o aprendizado na
                  terceira. O Capítulo 1 aborda as questões referentes
                  à estrutura formal do trabalho e os aspectos
                  técnicos envolvidos em sua realização. O Capítulo 2
                  apresenta um breve histórico da geração da Teoria,
                  detalhes da documentação do PCN, e comentários sobre
                  a tradução do livro: Introduction to Post-Tonal
                  Theory, do Dr. Joseph N.  Straus, tradução essa que
                  autorizada pelo autor vai em anexo. Esse capítulo
                  motiva o Apêndice 1, o qual contém dados
                  estatísticos sobre as obras mais utilizadas como
                  exemplo para tópicos da Teoria. O Capítulo 3
                  compreende basicamente as questões relativas ao
                  Tutorial e remete-se a três apêndices: o Apêndice 2,
                  que lista acrônimos ligados à XML (linguagem de
                  marcação utilizada no Tutorial); o Apêndice 3, que
                  inclui a documentação do XML Schema e a codificação
                  em XML do Tutorial; e o Apêndice 4, que traz a
                  composição musical originada da resolução dos
                  exercícios. Finalmente, o Capítulo 4 contém a
                  conclusão do trabalho. Há também um CD anexo
                  contendo o Tutorial, a documentação do Schema em
                  formato HTML, e uma gravação digital da composição.},

                  programs in conservatories, colleges, and
                  universities. Many teachers consider it as important
                  in the development of young musicians as listening
                  and performance. It can be argued that through
                  compositions musicians achieve the deepest
                  insightinto the composer and his music. Musical
                  Composition takes the student through the
                  elements--melody, harmony, counterpoint, and
                  rhythm--before covering a variety of special
                  subjects such as writing vocal and choral music,
                  accompaniments, and film and TV music.  Chapters are
                  devoted to recenttechniques including free
                  diatonicism, serialism, and indeterminacy. Over 200

  school =       {University of Wisconsin-Madison},
  year =         1995,
  abstract =     {Contour is a generalization of melodic direction (in
                  particular, ascending and descending motion), but it
                  is not routinely considered a primary delineator of
                  structure in most tonal music. A melody in a
                  common-practice work might leap to a high register
                  and then suddenly reverse itself at a particularly
                  crucial moment. Although this melody interacts with
                  other musical events, one would probably interpret
                  its contour as a contributor to--but not a primary
                  delineator of--musical structure. But contour
                  possesses an increased potential to create
                  structural associations in post-tonal music
                  (specifically atonal or motivic music), where the
                  melodic and harmonic progressions of tonal music are
                  absent. Contour relations are analyzed in a group of
                  atonal works by Webern: Sechs Bagatellen, op.  9;
                  Drei kleine Stücke, op. 11; the Fünf
                  Orchesterstücke, op. 10; and the Orchesterstücke
                  (1913). These works lack certain types of pitch
                  organization, such as overt tonal references and
                  12-tone techniques, which often account for
                  structural associations. In the absence of these
                  systems of pitch organization, contour becomes a
                  significiant structural factor on the melodic level
                  and in larger expanses of music. The melodic
                  properties most important to the formation of
                  contour are identified. Selected contour definitions
                  are reviewed. Four interpretive assumptions by which
                  contour can be evaluated are proposed, and four
                  analyses of contour relations in complete works (one
                  movement from each opus) are discussed. Various
                  associational and transformational relations between
                  melodic contour, a medial level of structure labeled
                  textural contour, and the contour of the entire
                  piece are examined.},

                  together under the "Neo-Riemannian"
                  designation. This introductory essay sketches the
                  origins and recent development of neo-Riemannian
                  theory, and positions it with respect to several
                  other genera of music theory, as well as to an
                  evolving post-structuralist critical practice. Along
                  the way, it seeks to situate Hugo Riemann amidst the
                  flurry of activity occuring beneath the banner
                  bearing his name, and to provide comfort to the
                  perplexed observer who, innocently prying apart
                  these covers and peering within, spies the
                  theoretical tradition of A. B. Marx and Oettingen
                  romping merrily with that of Babbitt, Forte, and
                  Morris.  Strange fellows indeed!... or perhaps, upon
                  reflection, not so strange....}

  abstract =     {This article develops a two-component model of how
                  melodies are stored in long and short-term
                  memory. The first component is the overlearned
                  perceptual-motor schema of the musical
                  scale. Evidence is presented supportin the lifetime
                  stability of scales and the fact that they seem to
                  have basically logarithmic form
                  cross-culturally. The second component, melodic
                  contour, is shown to function independently of pitch
                  interval sequence in memory. A new experiment is
                  reported, using a recognition memory paradigm in
                  which tonal standard stimuli are confused with
                  same-contour comparisons, whether they are exact
                  transpositions of tonal answers, but not with atonal
                  comparison stimuli. This result is contrasted with
                  earlier owrk using atonal melodies and shows the
                  interdependence of the two components, scale and
                  contour.},

  abstract =     {This dissertation deals with the application of
                  several recent theories of music to musicianship
                  training. The theories concern: (1) the hierarchical
                  nature of tonal melody, (2) reduction techniques
                  which reveal common tonal patterns at various levels
                  of structure, (3) the relationship of these common
                  patterns to theories of the diatonic system, and (4)
                  pedagogical concepts for developing musical
                  skills. The theorists whose work most clearly
                  represents each of these areas include Heinrich
                  Schenker (tonal melody as hierarchical), Fred
                  Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff (rhythmic reduction),
                  Robert Morris (contour reduction), John Clough (the
                  diatonic system), and Erzsébet Hegyi (aural skills
                  pedagogy). After a presentation of the theories,
                  commonalities and correspondences among them become
                  the basis of a synthesis, presented as a working
                  theory. This working theory in turn serves as the
                  basis for exercises and activities in aural skills
                  training. Musicianship training focuses primarily on
                  features that are on the surface of the
                  melody. Schenkeršs theories reveal the hierarchical
                  nature of tonal music, but deal more thoroughly with
                  middleground and background structures. Therefore,
                  reduction techniques that concentrate on levels
                  close to the surface of the melody are more
                  important here. Two reduction techniques are
                  advocated: one of these selects members of a higher
                  level through regular rhythmic patterns, the other
                  through contour pitches. Patterns that are revealed
                  at various structural levels are common tonal ones
                  consisting of scales, scale segments, triads,
                  seventh chords, neighbor note figures, sequences,
                  and non scalar segments of 3­5 pitches. These
                  patterns are referable to (ordered) diatonic
                  segments as members of various segment classes. A
                  theory is devised to accomodate various classes of
                  pitch and pitch-class segments and unordered
                  pitch-class sets. The patterns become the focus for
                  aural training exercises and activities designed
                  primarily to improve skills in ear training, sight
                  singing, improvisation, and dictation.},

  year =         1993,
  author =       {Antony Hopkins},
  review =       {In this remarkable book, Antony Hopkins shows how
                  the entire orchestra acts as a distinct musical
                  instrument, one which composers have played upon
                  over the centuries to express every mood, from the
                  most sublime to the most frivolous. In so doing, he
                  explains the ways in which a composer's "signature
                  in sound" develops, from the subtly exotic pattern
                  of a Bartok theme to the sensuously evocative chords
                  in Debussy. Hopkins offers an in-depth look at the
                  origins of the orchestra itself, an evolutionary
                  process that took the better part of two centuries
                  in Europe, yet finds its roots in our ancient
                  past. He begins his discussion in ancient Egypt,
                  Greece, and Rome, moves through the music of
                  medieval Europe, and ultimately reaches a watershed
                  moment in the history of the orchestra as we now
                  know it: the composition of Bach's Brandenburg
                  Concertos in the early eighteenth century.  Having
                  introduced the various instruments, explained the
                  development of their groupings, and demonstrated how
                  the blending of their tones led to the orchestral
                  sounds of the modern era, he provides an incisive
                  examination of actual compositions. Expertly guiding
                  readers through representative pieces by Mozart,
                  Schubert, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and
                  Britten, Hopkins offers a unique and insightful
                  companion for beginning and more seasoned
                  concert-goers alike.},

  abstract =     {The theoretical and experimental literatures
                  pertaining to pitch-related accent are
                  reviewed. From these literatures, eight competing
                  notions of melodic accent are identified.  All eight
                  conceptions of melodic accent were investigated
                  through correlational studies of three contrasting
                  samples of music. Statistical correlations were
                  calculated for each accent type with respect to the
                  corresponding metric position or with respecto to
                  the syllabic/melismatic status of associated sung
                  text. The results for all three studies are most
                  consistent with a perceptual model of melodic accent
                  developed by Joseph thomassen (1982). The remaining
                  conceptions of melodic accent receibe little or no
                  empirical support. In addition, this study reveals
                  an endemic use of text-melody displacement on a
                  sample of Gregorian chant---suggesting that the
                  chant melodies were constructed so as to avoid
                  strong rhythmic stresses.},

                  subjects were required to repeat short melodies
                  presented over headphones. Subjects' performances
                  were recorded and analyzed, revealing that errors in
                  musical performance followed certain patterns across
                  all subjects. An important finding was that errors
                  remained constant regardless of note distance in
                  time and frequency. This result suggests that
                  subjects use an enhanced melodic contour as their
                  basic representational form. A model based on this
                  Þnding for use in computer-driven melody recognition
                  is proposed.  Query-by-humming, other applications,
                  and future research directions are also discussed.},

                  have composed the "Hammerklavier" Sonata without the
                  aid of a desk (or standard-format) sketchbook: the
                  surviving desk sketches for the sonata are to be
                  found on a number of loose leaves and bifolia
                  only. An examination of the concordances between
                  these sources, some of which are introduced here for
                  the first time, and the pocket sketchbooks
                  containing material for the sonata makes it possible
                  to place the loose desk leaves in a tentative order,
                  and thus lays the foundations for a future study of
                  the genesis of the sonata. The present study also
                  uses the pocket sketchbooks to identify previously
                  unsuspected desk sketches for the sonata, and traces
                  the persistence in these of early plans for the
                  tonal structure of the work.},

                  theories of pitch- and set-class structure do not
                  reflect listeners' aural perception of sounding
                  music as effectively as theories modelling the
                  articulation of these underlying structures on the
                  musical surface. This position is supported by a
                  review of pertinent music-theoretical and
                  music-psychological research. Based upon the data
                  collected by various music-psychologists, published
                  elsewhere but compared and critiqued here, this
                  study concludes that listeners generally use figural
                  cues drawn from musical context --- for example,
                  melodic shapes, changes of direction, relative
                  durationnal patterns, and so on --- to retain and
                  recognize musical ideas in short-term memory.  These
                  figural cues may be represented in precise notation
                  and compared with one another by application and
                  generalization of Robert Morris's contour theories.
                  Morris's comparison matrix and contour equivalence
                  relations are introduced here, followed by this
                  author's generalization of the thwory to duration
                  space and development of similarity relations for
                  melodic contours of relative pitch height and
                  rhythmic contours of relative suration
                  successions. The similarity relations for musical
                  contours build upon previous wort of Dabid Lewin,
                  Robert Morris, and John Rahn. While the efficacy of
                  these theories for modelling perceivable patterns in
                  musical contexts cannot be proven without further
                  psychological testing, their applicability to
                  musical analysis is demonstrated.  Analyses drawn
                  form the music of Bartok, Webern, Berg, and Varèse
                  illustrate ways in which melodic and rhythmic
                  contour relationships may be used to shape a formal
                  scheme to differentiate melody from accompaniment,
                  to associate musical ideas that belong to different
                  set classes, and to create unity throuth varied
                  repetition. The concluding chapter explores avenues
                  for future work. A section on music-psychological
                  experimentation offers a critical overview of
                  research in this area and proposes ideas for future
                  experimentation. Second, the implications of
                  music-psychological research for the pedagogy of
                  non-tonal music theory are considered and a model
                  curriculum for non-tonal music theory proposed. The
                  dissertation concludes by proposing a number of ways
                  in which contour theory might be generalized to
                  other domains and illustrates the application of one
                  such generalization to the analysis of chord spacing
                  in a piano work of Luigi Dallapiccola.},

                  work on musical contour by Richard Bassein, Robert
                  Cogan. Pozzi Escot, Michael Friedmann, Paul Laprade,
                  Elizabeth Marvin.  Robert Morris, Larry Polansky,
                  and James Tenney. To this end. Schoenberg's Piano
                  Piece, Op. 19 No. 4 is analyzed.  Its pc-set
                  segmentations are associated with relations among
                  sets of equivalent contours. The main part of the
                  paper introduces the contour reduction algorithm,
                  based on principles of perceptual organization from
                  gestalt psychology. The algorithm allows one to
                  associate nonadjacent contour pitches according to
                  their degree of salience. Any contour can be reduced
                  to one of a set of irreducible prime contours that
                  defines its characteristit depth. The algorithm is
                  applied to the six phrases of the Schoenberg piece
                  and the result resonates well with the previous
                  contouripc-set analysis. The hierarchic nature of
                  the algorithm also helps organize the many classes
                  of equivalent contours. Morris's definition of a
                  contour as the association of any two sets leads to
                  the construction of a taxonomy including all
                  possible contours. Contours that include replication
                  and simultaneities are defined by various categories
                  in mathematical relation theory. The paper includes
                  a discussion of the role of salience in musical
                  structure. The contour reduction algorithm is
                  compared to familiar reductive methodologies of
                  tonal music and the perceptual gestalt theories of
                  Tenney and Polansky.},

  abstract =     {This paper studies networks of pitch-classes that
                  model voice-leading-the progression of pitches to
                  form horizontal "voices" or "lines." While tonal
                  voice-leading depends on distinctions between step
                  and leap, consonance and dissonance, chord-tone and
                  embellishment, voice-leading in post-tonal music
                  simply and non-normatively describes the motions of
                  pitches, one to another. First, I stipulate some
                  limitations on totally free voice-leading and
                  construct a complete taxonomy of voice-leading
                  motions. Then I examine Richard Cohn's explicit
                  coupling of transformation and voice-leading of
                  major and minor triads as represented on Hugo
                  Riemann's tonnetz. The tonnetz is a traditional
                  example of what I have previously called a
                  compositional space; such spaces are out-of-time
                  networks of pcs that can underlie compositional or
                  improvisational action. After studying various
                  transformations of the tonnetz, voice-leading is
                  implemented by the use of another type of
                  compositional space, two-partition graphs. These
                  graphs are generalized so that pairs of pcsets
                  connected in the graph need not be disjoint nor form
                  members of only one set class. Any specified voice
                  motions can be stipulated. The result is a
                  collection of voice-leading spaces, a new category
                  of compositional space. Finally, I describe an
                  algorithm that allows one to construct voice-leading
                  spaces of any degree of complexity or closure.},

                  indeterminação como elementos estruturais. Partindo
                  de uma contextualização das práticas e tendências
                  musicais que enfatizam o fenômeno da indeterminação,
                  é feita uma reflexão filosófica sobre o papel da
                  experiência na música aleatória e experimental,
                  enfatizando a importância da idéia de novidade e sua
                  associação com o acaso. A poética compositiva e o
                  aspecto virtual da forma são as bases sobre as quais
                  se fundamentam as análises das peças.},

                  especially the mathematics of an abstract definition
                  of contour itself. In hope of establishing a general
                  formulation that will be of use to more specific,
                  style- and genre-related theoretical work in
                  contour, a "non-stylistic" approach is
                  taken. Specific musical situations (like the
                  equivalence classes generated by elementary
                  transformations, or musical assumptions made by
                  ethnomusicological contour studies) are not invoked.
                  Further generalization of the theory of the "number
                  of possible contours" includes the formulation of a
                  theory of contour for asymmetrical and non-ternary
                  contour descriptions, one we believe to be of
                  musical interest. We assume that contour may be
                  applied to any parameter of music, at any
                  hierarchical level. These ideas may be used in the
                  analysis of waveforms, melody, the sequence of pitch
                  means in some large-scale segmentation of a piece,
                  or any other quantifiable parameter.},

  abstract =     { O Teatro São João da cidade de Salvador (BA)
                  funcionou entre 1812 e 1922. Nele circularam, além
                  dos artistas, todos os estratos da sociedade
                  baiana. Recentemente foi encontrada, na seção
                  colonial do Arquivo Público do Estado da Bahia, uma
                  documentação inédita referente ao período de criação
                  e estabelecimento do teatro (1806 a 1821). Este
                  material está distribuído em oito maços de
                  documentos, em diferentes formatos e tamanhos,
                  referentes à construção e ao funcionamento
                  administrativo e artístico do teatro. A grande
                  quantidade de informações contida nos maços é
                  bastante fragmentária, dificultando o estudo
                  sistematizado de tal documentação. O material
                  encontrado fornece informações referentes a artistas
                  e apresentações, apesar de não se tratar de
                  documentação musical (programas de concerto,
                  partitura). Para tanto foi necessário resolver o
                  problema da fragmentação das informações, com a
                  criação de, numa primeira etapa, um sistema de
                  códigos de localização de informações arquivais, e,
                  numa segunda etapa, um sistema informatizado de
                  disponibilização de informações. A partir do
                  conteúdo dos maços encontrados, desenvolvemos uma
                  classificação própria que leva em conta o sistema de
                  organização utilizado pelo Arquivo Público do Estado
                  da Bahia, além de permitir a inclusão de novos
                  documentos, originários de outros arquivos ou
                  instituições. Após esta etapa, iniciamos
                  desenvolvimento do sistema que, em uma primeira
                  versão, contempla apenas informações relativas a
                  artistas. Para seu desenvolvimento levamos em conta
                  as necessidades de consulta do material e a futura
                  conexão com outras bases de dados construídas em
                  pesquisas na área de Musicologia na Bahia, como a
                  desenvolvida por Pablo Sotuyo Blanco, sobre o
                  Patrimônio Musical na Bahia e a coordenada por
                  Manuel Veiga, sobre Impressão Musical na Bahia. Além
                  de apresentar soluções aos problemas inerentes ao
                  gerenciamento das informações encontradas, o
                  presente projeto de pesquisa fornece subsídios para
                  uma abordagem sociológica do Teatro São
                  João. Adotando o conceito de figuração, desenvolvido
                  por Norbert Elias, todas as pessoas envolvidas com o
                  teatro passam a constituir uma formação social em
                  que os indivíduos estão ligados entre si por meio de
                  dependências recíprocas, tendo, neste caso, o teatro
                  como centro. Tal abordagem transcende as fronteiras
                  tradicionais da Musicologia Histórica, porém, faz-se
                  necessária para uma melhor compreensão da Música e
                  dos músicos durante este período da vida cultural
                  brasileira.},

                  funcionou entre 1812 e 1922. Ele foi o palco
                  principal da representação dos valores culturais,
                  estéticos e políticos da elite baiana, e também foi
                  testemunha das mudanças que ocorreram nesta
                  sociedade em um período decisivo para a consolidação
                  do Brasil enquanto nação independente. Nele
                  circularam, além dos artistas, todos os estratos da
                  sociedade baiana. O presente trabalho propõe uma
                  abordagem da relação profissional existente entre os
                  artistas---atores e músicos---e o Teatro São João,
                  enquanto empregador, durante o período colonial. O
                  trabalho se baseia na análise de documentos de
                  conteúdo administrativo e contábil referentes ao
                  teatro, no período de 1806 a 1821, encontrados no
                  Arquivo Público do Estado da Bahia. Para esta
                  análise, faz-se uso da Sociologia. Adotando o

                  relations between pairs of contours produced by a
                  number of different models are examined. Two of
                  these models, based on the music-theoretic
                  approaches of Friedmann (1985) and Marvin and
                  Laprade (1987), characterize contours in terms of
                  interval content of contour subset information. The
                  remaining two approaches quantify the global shape
                  of the contours, through the presence of cyclical
                  information (assessed via Fourier analysis) and the
                  amount of oscillation (e.g. reversals in direction,
                  pitch deviations) in the contours. Theoretical
                  predictions for contour similarity generated by
                  these models were examined for 20th century,
                  nontonal melodies (Experiment 1) and simplistic,
                  tonal patterns (Experiment 2). These experiments
                  demonstrated that similarity based on Fourier
                  analysis procedures and oscillation measures
                  predicted a derived measure of perceived similarity,
                  with both variables contributing relatively
                  independently; the music-theoretic models were
                  inconsistent in their predictive power. These
                  results suggest that listeners are sensitive to the
                  presence of global shape information in melodic
                  contour, with such information underlying the
                  perception of contour structure and contour

                  containing alterations which shift them a long
                  distance (harmonically) from the original should be
                  considered perceptually dissimilar relative to the
                  original. It is possible to obtain such a large
                  shift with a small change in melodic pitch. However,
                  this creates a paradox with pitch (contour)
                  shifting, which is known to reduce similarity
                  minimally if the distance from the original is
                  small. We investigated the hypotheses that (1)
                  manipulations to contour and implied harmony of an
                  original melody reduce similarity scores and (2)
                  novices are less sensitive to implied harmony
                  changes than experts, but as sensitive as experts to
                  contour manipulations. Twenty-eight novices and 44
                  expert musicians rated similarity of familiar
                  nursery rhyme tunes compared with close and distant
                  harmonic transformations plus close and distant
                  pitch shifts. Results indicated that both groups use
                  contour (pitch distance) to determine similarity,
                  but that musically experienced listeners also use
                  implied harmony to make further distinctions. It is
                  argued that as listeners become more experienced,
                  they rely on more sophisticated strategies for
                  encoding and organizing melodies in memory, with
                  deeper structural aspects of music being used when
                  other strategies such as contour are uninformative
                  or non-distinctive. These new findings, that contour
                  and harmony affect judged similarity for simple,
                  familiar melodies, have implications for theories of
                  memory for music, and for the design of automated
                  music retrieval and data mining systems.},

                  melodic contour structure in Olivier Messiaen's
                  mature birdsong. Following some key refinements to
                  Robert Morris's (1993) Contour-Reduction Algorithm
                  and prime contour classification system, the
                  algorithm is applied to various passages from
                  Messeaen's Réveil des Oiseaux and birdsong
                  transcriptions in Tome V of his Traité de rythme, de
                  Couleur, et d'Ornithologie, thereby revealing the
                  existence of numerous nonretrogradable patterns,
                  barying in both nature and degree of exactitude, at
                  a deeeper level of structure. The article then
                  discusses the specific features that these patterns
                  exhibit, and explores some of the major issues
                  involved in carrying out an analysis of this kind.
                  Finally, evidence is offered in support of the
                  assertion that these contour symmetries represent a
                  concrete manifestation of Messiaen's self-admitted
                  tendency to unintentionally insert his own

                  research into musical contour theory has indeed
                  yielded a plethora of vital analytical and
                  methodological insights, a crucial phenomenological
                  problem remains to be fully addressed: its implicit
                  reliance upon a synchronous analytical perspective
                  whereby a contour’s constituent elements, though
                  ordered in time, are in fact interpreted as fully
                  and simultaneously present entities. The musical
                  processes that these contours describe, however,
                  obviously do not present themselves in this
                  manner—their constituent elements occur in direct
                  succession, not simultaneously. Such contours,
                  therefore, cannot be regarded as truly autonomous
                  musical objects; rather, they represent but a single
                  link—albeit the crucial, culminating link—in a
                  cumulative transformational chain of contours that
                  unfolds diachronically. The contour <1023>, for
                  instance, begins as the singleton <0>, and evolves
                  successively into <10> (its first two elements) and
                  <102> (its first three elements) before coming to
                  exist as such. This dissertation develops a system
                  of contour relations that is fully contingent upon
                  this implicit process. Chapter One introduces and
                  develops the basic principles involved in such an
                  approach, which is centered around the construction
                  of a universal contour tree diagram that provides
                  the foundation for relating contours based on the
                  similarity of their diachronic-transformational
                  histories. Chapter Two provides a more comprehensive
                  account of the contour transformational process by
                  incorporating C-Pitch Adjacency Subsets (C-PAS) into
                  the system. This necessitates the development of
                  contour relationship “networks” and the subsequent
                  organization of them into their own hierarchy of
                  relationship types. In Chapter Three, these
                  principles are applied to the multi-level structural
                  space generated by Robert Morris’s (1993)
                  Contour-Reduction Algorithm, which not only extends
                  their utility beyond the strictly foreground level,
                  but also reveals some striking new principles and
                  systems of relations. Chapter Four demonstrates the
                  efficacy and novelty of the
                  diachronic-transformational approach through the
                  analysis of musical excerpts from works by
                  Beethoven, Berg, Webern, Messiaen, and
                  Holland-Dozier-Holland. Finally, Chapter Five offers
                  some concluding remarks and explores the potential
                  for future research using this methodology.},

  abstract =     {This paper discusses an analysis of Jean-Claude
                  Risset's Contours , a tape work composed in 1982
                  using only computer sound synthesis. The analysis is
                  based on recorded traces of the compositional
                  process (Music code listings, verbal and graphical
                  annotations), and focuses on sound design
                  criteria. It attempts to elucidate the connection
                  between these criteria and the overall structure of
                  the musical work. In short, it investigates the
                  observable link between ''composing-the-sound'' and
                  ''composing-with-sounds'' in the making of Contours
                  . The psychoacoustic relationship of pitch to timbre
                  is crucial, and was a primary concern in all of
                  Risset's operations in composing this work. In order
                  to let a particular pitch contour either dissolve,
                  or emerge from various timbral transformations, the
                  composer devised several ad hoc sound design
                  strategies strictly functional to the compositional
                  concept. Further remarks are proposed concerning a
                  twofold aesthetic dimension peculiar to this music:
                  on the one hand, we have a legacy to the French
                  tradition of musical impressionism; on the other, we
                  have a more constructivist attitude, hidden behind
                  what at first may sound as a decorative interplay of
                  fascinating sound colors.},

                  atonal voice leading, a model of pitch-class
                  counterpoint to connect any two harmonies. Voice
                  leadings are evaluated by three criteria: (1)
                  uniformity: the extent to which the voices move by
                  the same interval distance and thus approach
                  traditional transposition; (2) balance: the extent
                  to which the voices move by the same index number
                  and thus approach traditional inversion; and (3)
                  smoothness: the extent to which the voices travel
                  the shortest possible distance. The most uniform,
                  most balanced, or smoothest way of moving from one
                  set to another in pitch-class space, or from one set
                  class to another in a proposed voice-leading space,
                  provides a standpoint from which to assess any
                  specific compositional realization in pitch space.}

                  ferramental teórico a pitch class theory e a análise
                  de contornos conforme Friedmann, buscando
                  fundamentação para a observação de aspectos de

                  a lógica compositiva da peça com intenções
                  semântico-expressivas manifestadas por Widmer,

                  constructive process in which physical cues are
                  matched against anticipated accents. The
                  anticipation of the observer can experimentally be
                  controlled by embedding the short tone sequence to
                  be investigated in a context with a meter: method of
                  controlled anticipation. An investigation of melodic
                  accentuation, resulting from the succession of
                  frequency intervbals, revealed that in principle
                  every change of frequency level between two
                  successive tones can be interpreted as accentuation
                  of ofpposite directions operates as the strongest
                  accentuation, whereas two intervals in the same
                  direction are equally effective. The effect of
                  relative magnitude is less pronounced. Only in the
                  case of clearly diverging relative magnitudes the
                  largest interval is the most powerful, particularly
                  when the intervals are in the same direction. The
                  advantage of rises over falls is almost
                  negligible. The short-term influence of physical
                  factors on momentary accent perception allows for a
                  description in terms of a "memory window" sliding
                  along the tone sequence. At each moment the
                  frequencies within the window provide the physical
                  cue for accent that has to be matched agains
                  anticipation. If the span of the window is minimal,
                  i.e., three tones, accent perception in sequences of
                  four tones, embedded according to the method of
                  controlled anticipation, has been accounted for
                  fairly well, the correlation coefficient between
                  predictions and outcomes being 0.76.},
