  abstract	= {Musical composition is a key discipline in music programs
		  in conservatories, colleges, and universities. Many
		  teachers consider it as important in the development of
		  young musicians as listening and performance. It can be
		  argued that through compositions musicians achieve the
		  deepest insightinto the composer and his music. Musical
		  Composition takes the student through the elements--melody,
		  harmony, counterpoint, and rhythm--before covering a
		  variety of special subjects such as writing vocal and
		  choral music, accompaniments, and film and TV music.
		  Chapters are devoted to recenttechniques including free
		  diatonicism, serialism, and indeterminacy. Over 200
		  examples illustrate points in the text and there are
		  exercises for each chapter.}
