  abstract	= {Since the time of the Ancient Greeks, much has been
		  written about the relation between mathematics and music:
		  from harmony and number theory, to musical patterns and
		  group theory. Benson provides a wealth of information here
		  to enable the teacher, the student, or the interested
		  amateur to understand, at varying levels of technicality,
		  the real interplay between these two ancient disciplines.
		  The story is long as well as broad and involves physics,
		  biology, psycho acoustics, the history of science, and
		  digital technology as well as, of course, mathematics and
		  music. Starting with the structure of the human ear and its
		  relationship with Fourier analysis, the story proceeds via
		  the mathematics of musical instruments to the ideas of
		  consonance and dissonance, and then to scales and
		  temperaments. This is a must-have book if you want to know
		  about the music of the spheres or digital music and many
		  things in between.},
