                  nonbeat-based rhythms as "rhythmic contours" of
                  relative longs and shorts, drawing upon discussions
                  of temporal spaces appearing in recent work of
                  Robert Morris and David Lewin and upon various
                  music-psychological investigations of rhythmic
                  perception. A new type of temporal space is
                  proposed: a duration space (d-space) analogous to
                  Morris's contour space, in which elements are
                  ordered sequentially from short to long. After
                  developing equivalence relations for d-space
                  segments, illustrated by excerpts from Edgard
                  Varese's Octandre, the paper concludes with an
                  analysis of Density 21.5 that focuses upon
                  relationships among rhythmic contours.},

                  melodies are stored in long and short-term
                  memory. The first component is the overlearned
                  perceptual-motor schema of the musical
                  scale. Evidence is presented supportin the lifetime
                  stability of scales and the fact that they seem to
                  have basically logarithmic form
                  cross-culturally. The second component, melodic
                  contour, is shown to function independently of pitch
                  interval sequence in memory. A new experiment is
                  reported, using a recognition memory paradigm in
                  which tonal standard stimuli are confused with
                  same-contour comparisons, whether they are exact
                  transpositions of tonal answers, but not with atonal
                  comparison stimuli. This result is contrasted with
                  earlier owrk using atonal melodies and shows the
                  interdependence of the two components, scale and
                  contour.},
