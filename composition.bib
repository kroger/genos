  abstract      = {Musical composition is a key discipline in music programs
                  in conservatories, colleges, and universities. Many
                  teachers consider it as important in the development of
                  young musicians as listening and performance. It can be
                  argued that through compositions musicians achieve the
                  deepest insightinto the composer and his music. Musical
                  Composition takes the student through the elements--melody,
                  harmony, counterpoint, and rhythm--before covering a
                  variety of special subjects such as writing vocal and
                  choral music, accompaniments, and film and TV music.
                  Chapters are devoted to recenttechniques including free
                  diatonicism, serialism, and indeterminacy. Over 200
                  examples illustrate points in the text and there are
                  exercises for each chapter.}
