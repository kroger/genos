		  amateur to understand, at varying levels of technicality,
		  the real interplay between these two ancient disciplines.
		  The story is long as well as broad and involves physics,
		  biology, psycho acoustics, the history of science, and
		  digital technology as well as, of course, mathematics and
		  music. Starting with the structure of the human ear and its
		  relationship with Fourier analysis, the story proceeds via
		  the mathematics of musical instruments to the ideas of
		  consonance and dissonance, and then to scales and
		  temperaments. This is a must-have book if you want to know

                  introductory essay sketches the origins and recent
                  development of neo-Riemannian theory, and positions
                  it with respect to several other genera of music
                  theory, as well as to an evolving post-structuralist
                  critical practice. Along the way, it seeks to
                  situate Hugo Riemann amidst the flurry of activity
                  occuring beneath the banner bearing his name, and to
                  provide comfort to the perplexed observer who,
                  innocently prying apart these covers and peering
                  within, spies the theoretical tradition of
                  A. B. Marx and Oettingen romping merrily with that

                  voice leading, a model of pitch-class counterpoint
                  to connect any two harmonies. Voice leadings are
                  evaluated by three criteria: (1) uniformity: the
                  extent to which the voices move by the same interval
                  distance and thus approach traditional
                  transposition; (2) balance: the extent to which the
                  voices move by the same index number and thus
                  approach traditional inversion; and (3) smoothness:
                  the extent to which the voices travel the shortest
                  possible distance. The most uniform, most balanced,
                  or smoothest way of moving from one set to another
                  in pitch-class space, or from one set class to
                  another in a proposed voice-leading space, provides
                  a standpoint from which to assess any specific
                  compositional realization in pitch space.}

  pages =     {175--208},
  abstract	=    {This paper studies networks of pitch-classes that
                  model voice-leading-the progression of pitches to
                  form horizontal "voices" or "lines." While tonal
                  voice-leading depends on distinctions between step
                  and leap, consonance and dissonance, chord-tone and
                  embellishment, voice-leading in post-tonal music
                  simply and non-normatively describes the motions of
                  pitches, one to another. First, I stipulate some
                  limitations on totally free voice-leading and
                  construct a complete taxonomy of voice-leading
                  motions. Then I examine Richard Cohn's explicit
                  coupling of transformation and voice-leading of
                  major and minor triads as represented on Hugo
                  Riemann's tonnetz. The tonnetz is a traditional
                  example of what I have previously called a
                  compositional space; such spaces are out-of-time
                  networks of pcs that can underlie compositional or
                  improvisational action. After studying various
                  transformations of the tonnetz, voice-leading is
                  implemented by the use of another type of
                  compositional space, two-partition graphs. These
                  graphs are generalized so that pairs of pcsets
                  connected in the graph need not be disjoint nor form
                  members of only one set class. Any specified voice
                  motions can be stipulated. The result is a
                  collection of voice-leading spaces, a new category
                  of compositional space. Finally, I describe an
                  algorithm that allows one to construct voice-leading
                  spaces of any degree of complexity or closure.},

  abstract	= { O Teatro São João da cidade de Salvador (BA) funcionou
                  entre 1812 e 1922. Nele circularam, além dos
                  artistas, todos os estratos da sociedade
                  baiana. Recentemente foi encontrada, na seção
                  colonial do Arquivo Público do Estado da Bahia, uma
                  documentação inédita referente ao período de criação
                  e estabelecimento do teatro (1806 a 1821). Este
                  material está distribuído em oito maços de
                  documentos, em diferentes formatos e tamanhos,
                  referentes à construção e ao funcionamento
                  administrativo e artístico do teatro. A grande
                  quantidade de informações contida nos maços é
                  bastante fragmentária, dificultando o estudo
                  sistematizado de tal documentação. O material
                  encontrado fornece informações referentes a artistas
                  e apresentações, apesar de não se tratar de
                  documentação musical (programas de concerto,
                  partitura). Para tanto foi necessário resolver o
                  problema da fragmentação das informações, com a
                  criação de, numa primeira etapa, um sistema de
                  códigos de localização de informações arquivais, e,
                  numa segunda etapa, um sistema informatizado de
                  disponibilização de informações. A partir do
                  conteúdo dos maços encontrados, desenvolvemos uma
                  classificação própria que leva em conta o sistema de
                  organização utilizado pelo Arquivo Público do Estado
                  da Bahia, além de permitir a inclusão de novos
                  documentos, originários de outros arquivos ou
                  instituições. Após esta etapa, iniciamos
                  desenvolvimento do sistema que, em uma primeira
                  versão, contempla apenas informações relativas a
                  artistas. Para seu desenvolvimento levamos em conta
                  as necessidades de consulta do material e a futura
                  conexão com outras bases de dados construídas em
                  pesquisas na área de Musicologia na Bahia, como a
                  desenvolvida por Pablo Sotuyo Blanco, sobre o
                  Patrimônio Musical na Bahia e a coordenada por
                  Manuel Veiga, sobre Impressão Musical na Bahia. Além
                  de apresentar soluções aos problemas inerentes ao
                  gerenciamento das informações encontradas, o
                  presente projeto de pesquisa fornece subsídios para
                  uma abordagem sociológica do Teatro São
                  João. Adotando o conceito de figuração, desenvolvido
                  por Norbert Elias, todas as pessoas envolvidas com o
                  teatro passam a constituir uma formação social em
                  que os indivíduos estão ligados entre si por meio de
                  dependências recíprocas, tendo, neste caso, o teatro
                  como centro. Tal abordagem transcende as fronteiras
                  tradicionais da Musicologia Histórica, porém, faz-se
                  necessária para uma melhor compreensão da Música e
                  dos músicos durante este período da vida cultural
                  brasileira.},

                  artistas---atores e músicos---e o Teatro São João,

                  trabalho se baseia na análise de documentos de

                  teatro, no período de 1806 a 1821, encontrados no

		  of the change in one musical parameter as a function of
		  another. In my dissertation, contour theories proposed by
		  Robert Morris, Michael Friedmann, Elizabeth Marvin, Paul
		  Laprade, Ian Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky
		  and Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these authors
		  approach changes in pitch as a function of time. A
		  commonality between these theories was shown to be the use
		  of a system of pitch level identification based on the
		  relative highness or lowness of the pitches, not based on
		  actual pitch frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody.
		  Additionally, these theories did not account for rhythmic
		  or durational elements of the pitches as they are
		  articulated in time. Music perception studies were cited
		  that indicated that contour can play an important role in
		  the recognition and memory of a melody, and that pitch
		  interval and rhythmic components are vital elements in
		  music understanding. Because these contour theories lacked
		  the important musical elements of pitch and rhythm, an
		  analytical method for the study of musical contour that
		  incorporates both of these in its model of a melody is
		  developed. This analytical method uses the mathematical
		  technique of multiple linear regression to develop a model
		  of the melody that can be graphed as representative of the
		  contour of the actual melody. This method was used to
		  analyze the first themes from the first movements of the
		  nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using regression
		  modeling, the sonata melodies were categorized into two
		  melody types: Type MD and Type LB. Analytical methods
		  proposed by other theorists were then used to analyze
		  selected melodies, and a comparison between the multiple
		  linear regression model and these results was made.},

  abstract = {This dissertation takes work on contour by Robert Morris
                  as a point of departure and develops a set of
                  contour reduction algorithms, called "window
                  algorithms." These involve the notion of a
                  hypothetical window or frame of a specific width
                  (i.e. number of events) through which the contour
                  succession in a given melody is experienced
                  temporally (much like the way a landscape is
                  experienced visually through the side window of a
                  moving automobile or train. Certain normative
                  principles relevant to windows of various widths are
                  devised and represented with the help of symbolic
                  logic and flowcharts. Reiterative application of the
                  window algorithms on a melody to "prune" pitches at
                  a series of successive levels, introduces notions of
                  melodic contour hierarchy that are explored in
                  various ways throughout the dissertation. The
                  application of the algorithms is demonstrated on a
                  variety of 20th century musical excerpts reflecting
                  a wide range of melodic archetypes, thereby enabling
                  observation of the behavior of the algorithms in
                  different musical contexts. Phenomenological and
                  cognitive implications of the algorithms are
                  discussed from the perspective of a listener
                  implementing the algorithm on the fly. An analysis
                  focusing on the Hauptstimmen in the first movement
                  of Schoenberg’s Third String Quartet explores how
                  intervallic features of the reduced contours can
                  form the basis for a tonal-formal reading of the
                  movement. The possibility of extending the theory to
                  the duration domain is also introduced; following a
                  preliminary analysis involving instrumental gestures
                  from the opening of Webern’s Variations for
                  Orchestra, and a discussion of analytical,
                  conceptual, and methodological inconsistencies
                  arising from the application of the algorithms on
                  duration contours, an alternative approach that
                  attaches appropriate durations to (reduced) pitch
                  contours is developed, examined, and advocated. The
                  relationships and interactions between the pitch and
                  duration contours in Berio’s Sequenza I are examined
                  in the light of the proposed theory.}

  year		= {1995},
  abstract	= {Contour is a generalization of melodic direction (in
		  particular, ascending and descending motion), but it is not
		  routinely considered a primary delineator of structure in
		  most tonal music. A melody in a common-practice work might
		  leap to a high register and then suddenly reverse itself at
		  a particularly crucial moment. Although this melody
		  interacts with other musical events, one would probably
		  interpret its contour as a contributor to--but not a
		  primary delineator of--musical structure. But contour
		  possesses an increased potential to create structural
		  associations in post-tonal music (specifically atonal or
		  motivic music), where the melodic and harmonic progressions
		  of tonal music are absent. Contour relations are analyzed
		  in a group of atonal works by Webern: Sechs Bagatellen, op.
		  9; Drei kleine Stücke, op. 11; the Fünf Orchesterstücke,
		  op. 10; and the Orchesterstücke (1913). These works lack
		  certain types of pitch organization, such as overt tonal
		  references and 12-tone techniques, which often account for
		  structural associations. In the absence of these systems of
		  pitch organization, contour becomes a significiant
		  structural factor on the melodic level and in larger
		  expanses of music. The melodic properties most important to
		  the formation of contour are identified. Selected contour
		  definitions are reviewed. Four interpretive assumptions by
		  which contour can be evaluated are proposed, and four
		  analyses of contour relations in complete works (one
		  movement from each opus) are discussed. Various
		  associational and transformational relations between
		  melodic contour, a medial level of structure labeled
		  textural contour, and the contour of the entire piece are
		  examined.},

                  corresponding metric position or with respecto to
                  the syllabic/melismatic status of associated sung
                  text. The results for all three studies are most
                  consistent with a perceptual model of melodic accent
                  developed by Joseph thomassen (1982). The remaining
                  conceptions of melodic accent receibe little or no
                  empirical support. In addition, this study reveals
                  an endemic use of text-melody displacement on a
                  sample of Gregorian chant---suggesting that the
                  chant melodies were constructed so as to avoid
                  strong rhythmic stresses.},

                  theories of pitch- and set-class structure do not
                  reflect listeners' aural perception of sounding
                  music as effectively as theories modelling the
                  articulation of these underlying structures on the
                  musical surface. This position is supported by a
                  review of pertinent music-theoretical and
                  music-psychological research. Based upon the data
                  collected by various music-psychologists, published
                  elsewhere but compared and critiqued here, this
                  study concludes that listeners generally use figural
                  cues drawn from musical context --- for example,
                  melodic shapes, changes of direction, relative
                  durationnal patterns, and so on --- to retain and
                  recognize musical ideas in short-term memory. These
                  figural cues may be represented in precise notation
                  and compared with one another by application and
                  generalization of Robert Morris's contour
                  theories. Morris's comparison matrix and contour
                  equivalence relations are introduced here, followed
                  by this author's generalization of the thwory to
                  duration space and development of similarity
                  relations for melodic contours of relative pitch
                  height and rhythmic contours of relative suration
                  successions. The similarity relations for musical
                  contours build upon previous wort of Dabid Lewin,
                  Robert Morris, and John Rahn. While the efficacy of
                  these theories for modelling perceivable patterns in
                  musical contexts cannot be proven without further
                  psychological testing, their applicability to
                  musical analysis is demonstrated. Analyses drawn
                  form the music of Bartok, Webern, Berg, and Varèse
                  illustrate ways in which melodic and rhythmic
                  contour relationships may be used to shape a formal
                  scheme to differentiate melody from accompaniment,
                  to associate musical ideas that belong to different
                  set classes, and to create unity throuth varied
                  repetition.  The concluding chapter explores avenues
                  for future work. A section on music-psychological
                  experimentation offers a critical overview of
                  research in this area and proposes ideas for future
                  experimentation. Second, the implications of
                  music-psychological research for the pedagogy of
                  non-tonal music theory are considered and a model
                  curriculum for non-tonal music theory proposed. The
                  dissertation concludes by proposing a number of ways
                  in which contour theory might be generalized to
                  other domains and illustrates the application of one
                  such generalization to the analysis of chord spacing
                  in a piano work of Luigi Dallapiccola.},

		  previous contouripc-set analysis. The hierarchic nature of
		  the algorithm also helps organize the many classes of
		  equivalent contours. Morris's definition of a contour as
		  the association of any two sets leads to the construction
		  of a taxonomy including all possible contours. Contours
		  that include replication and simultaneities are defined by
		  various categories in mathematical relation theory. The

                  approaches of Friedmann (1985) and Marvin and

                  of the contours, through the presence of cyclical

                  predictions for contour similarity generated by
                  these models were examined for 20th century,
                  nontonal melodies (Experiment 1) and simplistic,

		  in melodic pitch. However, this creates a paradox with
		  pitch (contour) shifting, which is known to reduce
		  similarity minimally if the distance from the original is
		  small. We investigated the hypotheses that (1)
		  manipulations to contour and implied harmony of an original
		  melody reduce similarity scores and (2) novices are less
		  sensitive to implied harmony changes than experts, but as
		  sensitive as experts to contour manipulations. Twenty-eight

		  pitch shifts. Results indicated that both groups use
		  contour (pitch distance) to determine similarity, but that
		  musically experienced listeners also use implied harmony to
		  make further distinctions. It is argued that as listeners
		  become more experienced, they rely on more sophisticated
		  strategies for encoding and organizing melodies in memory,
		  with deeper structural aspects of music being used when
		  other strategies such as contour are uninformative or
		  non-distinctive. These new findings, that contour and
		  harmony affect judged similarity for simple, familiar

  abstract =     {Although the relatively recent proliferation of
                  research into musical contour theory has indeed
                  yielded a plethora of vital analytical and
                  methodological insights, a crucial phenomenological
                  problem remains to be fully addressed: its implicit
                  reliance upon a synchronous analytical perspective
                  whereby a contour’s constituent elements, though
                  ordered in time, are in fact interpreted as fully
                  and simultaneously present entities. The musical
                  processes that these contours describe, however,
                  obviously do not present themselves in this
                  manner—their constituent elements occur in direct
                  succession, not simultaneously. Such contours,
                  therefore, cannot be regarded as truly autonomous
                  musical objects; rather, they represent but a single
                  link—albeit the crucial, culminating link—in a
                  cumulative transformational chain of contours that
                  unfolds diachronically. The contour <1023>, for
                  instance, begins as the singleton <0>, and evolves
                  successively into <10> (its first two elements) and
                  <102> (its first three elements) before coming to
                  exist as such.  This dissertation develops a system
                  of contour relations that is fully contingent upon
                  this implicit process. Chapter One introduces and
                  develops the basic principles involved in such an
                  approach, which is centered around the construction
                  of a universal contour tree diagram that provides
                  the foundation for relating contours based on the
                  similarity of their diachronic-transformational
                  histories. Chapter Two provides a more comprehensive
                  account of the contour transformational process by
                  incorporating C-Pitch Adjacency Subsets (C-PAS) into
                  the system. This necessitates the development of
                  contour relationship “networks” and the subsequent
                  organization of them into their own hierarchy of
                  relationship types. In Chapter Three, these
                  principles are applied to the multi-level structural
                  space generated by Robert Morris’s (1993)
                  Contour-Reduction Algorithm, which not only extends
                  their utility beyond the strictly foreground level,
                  but also reveals some striking new principles and
                  systems of relations. Chapter Four demonstrates the
                  efficacy and novelty of the
                  diachronic-transformational approach through the
                  analysis of musical excerpts from works by
                  Beethoven, Berg, Webern, Messiaen, and
                  Holland-Dozier-Holland. Finally, Chapter Five offers
                  some concluding remarks and explores the potential
                  for future research using this methodology.}

		  of the compositional process (Music code listings, verbal
		  and graphical annotations), and focuses on sound design
		  criteria. It attempts to elucidate the connection between
		  these criteria and the overall structure of the musical
		  work. In short, it investigates the observable link between
		  ''composing-the-sound'' and ''composing-with-sounds'' in
		  the making of Contours . The psychoacoustic relationship of
		  pitch to timbre is crucial, and was a primary concern in
		  all of Risset's operations in composing this work. In order
		  to let a particular pitch contour either dissolve, or
		  emerge from various timbral transformations, the composer
		  devised several ad hoc sound design strategies strictly
		  functional to the compositional concept. Further remarks
		  are proposed concerning a twofold aesthetic dimension
		  peculiar to this music: on the one hand, we have a legacy
		  to the French tradition of musical impressionism; on the
		  other, we have a more constructivist attitude, hidden
		  behind what at first may sound as a decorative interplay of
		  fascinating sound colors.},

  abstract  = {The perception of accent in tone sequences is a
                  constructive process in which physical cues are
                  matched against anticipated accents. The
                  anticipation of the observer can experimentally be
                  controlled by embedding the short tone sequence to
                  be investigated in a context with a meter: method of
                  controlled anticipation. An investigation of melodic
                  accentuation, resulting from the succession of
                  frequency intervbals, revealed that in principle
                  every change of frequency level between two
                  successive tones can be interpreted as accentuation
                  of ofpposite directions operates as the strongest
                  accentuation, whereas two intervals in the same
                  direction are equally effective. The effect of
                  relative magnitude is less pronounced. Only in the
                  case of clearly diverging relative magnitudes the
                  largest interval is the most powerful, particularly
                  when the intervals are in the same direction. The
                  advantage of rises over falls is almost
                  negligible. The short-term influence of physical
                  factors on momentary accent perception allows for a
                  description in terms of a "memory window" sliding
                  along the tone sequence. At each moment the
                  frequencies within the window provide the physical
                  cue for accent that has to be matched agains
                  anticipation. If the span of the window is minimal,
                  i.e., three tones, accent perception in sequences of
                  four tones, embedded according to the method of
                  controlled anticipation, has been accounted for
                  fairly well, the correlation coefficient between
                  predictions and outcomes being 0.76.},

  review	= {In this remarkable book, Antony Hopkins shows how the
		  entire orchestra acts as a distinct musical instrument, one
		  which composers have played upon over the centuries to
		  express every mood, from the most sublime to the most
		  frivolous. In so doing, he explains the ways in which a
		  composer's "signature in sound" develops, from the subtly
		  exotic pattern of a Bartok theme to the sensuously
		  evocative chords in Debussy. Hopkins offers an in-depth
		  look at the origins of the orchestra itself, an
		  evolutionary process that took the better part of two
		  centuries in Europe, yet finds its roots in our ancient
		  past. He begins his discussion in ancient Egypt, Greece,
		  and Rome, moves through the music of medieval Europe, and
		  ultimately reaches a watershed moment in the history of the
		  orchestra as we now know it: the composition of Bach's
		  Brandenburg Concertos in the early eighteenth century.
		  Having introduced the various instruments, explained the
		  development of their groupings, and demonstrated how the
		  blending of their tones led to the orchestral sounds of the
		  modern era, he provides an incisive examination of actual
		  compositions. Expertly guiding readers through
		  representative pieces by Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz,
		  Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Britten, Hopkins offers a unique
		  and insightful companion for beginning and more seasoned
		  concert-goers alike.},

                  nonbeat-based rhythms as "rhythmic contours" of
                  relative longs and shorts, drawing upon discussions
                  of temporal spaces appearing in recent work of
                  Robert Morris and David Lewin and upon various
                  music-psychological investigations of rhythmic
                  perception. A new type of temporal space is
                  proposed: a duration space (d-space) analogous to
                  Morris's contour space, in which elements are
                  ordered sequentially from short to long. After
                  developing equivalence relations for d-space
                  segments, illustrated by excerpts from Edgard
                  Varese's Octandre, the paper concludes with an
                  analysis of Density 21.5 that focuses upon
                  relationships among rhythmic contours.},

                  melodies are stored in long and short-term
                  memory. The first component is the overlearned
                  perceptual-motor schema of the musical
                  scale. Evidence is presented supportin the lifetime
                  stability of scales and the fact that they seem to
                  have basically logarithmic form
                  cross-culturally. The second component, melodic
                  contour, is shown to function independently of pitch
                  interval sequence in memory. A new experiment is
                  reported, using a recognition memory paradigm in
                  which tonal standard stimuli are confused with
                  same-contour comparisons, whether they are exact
                  transpositions of tonal answers, but not with atonal
                  comparison stimuli. This result is contrasted with
                  earlier owrk using atonal melodies and shows the
                  interdependence of the two components, scale and
                  contour.},
