                  music for "Le Grand Macabre" as a kind of "pop art,"
                  filled with quotations and references to opera and
                  other preexisting musical genres. Examining the
                  opera's thematic connections with the original play
                  by Michel de Ghelderode and Mikhail Bakhtin's
                  concept of grotesque realism, I suggest that
                  Ligeti's parodic approach in this opera is governed
                  by two narrative trajectories: the grotesque and
                  existential irony. Drawing on writings by Robert
                  Hatten, Linda Hutcheon, and Esti Sheinberg, this
                  paper develops semiotic constructs of mapping,
                  troping, and/or reversal in determining the parodic
                  procedures invoked. I argue that, through such
                  procedures, Ligeti engages with musical parody at
                  two levels: the surface level at which quotation of
                  existing music and musical styles are transformed
                  and the global level at which an expressive
                  opposition between ludicrousness and horror is
                  established in articulating the grotesque
                  trope. Furthermore, through deployment of collage
                  and textural disintegration, Ligeti creates an aural
                  counterpart to the allegorical depiction of chaos,
                  destruction, and renewal found in Breughel's
                  "Triumph of Death."},

                  a rhythmic template is transformed into a new rhythm
                  that departs from the underlying metric grid. In
                  this paper I examine two types of transformation
                  within the context of 1920s jazz. The Flux (F)
                  transformation distorts the original rhythmic
                  template by molding it into an acceleration, a
                  deceleration, or a combination of these.  The Shift
                  (S) transformation changes the global tempo of the
                  template. At the heart of these operations lies the
                  concept of an anchor, an on-the-beat synchronization
                  point between soloist and accompaniment that
                  metrically grounds the transformation. Soloists use
                  F and S--often in conjunction--to shape their
                  rhythms and to control the level of
                  tension/resolution in relation to the underlying
                  beat.},

                  are shifts of "duple phase"-- between "odd-strong"
                  hypermeter (in which odd-numbered measures are
                  strong) and "even-strong," or vice versa. I
                  distinguish between sudden and gradual shifts,
                  focusing on the latter type: A gradual hypermetrical
                  shift is a situation in which the musical cues for
                  hypermeter shift gradually from one structure to
                  another. (This does not necessarily mean our
                  perception of the shift is gradual, a separate and
                  complex issue which I also address.) Drawing an
                  analogy with transitions between keys, I call such
                  shifts "hypermetrical transitions." I examine
                  hypermetrical transitions in pieces by Mozart,
                  Beethoven, Chopin, and Mendelssohn, considering the
                  way the shift is carried out and its function within
                  the passage and the piece as a whole.},

                  movement of "Men and Mountains" (1927). Thereafter
                  canons grew increasingly important in his work,
                  growing in size and complexity until, in "Organum"
                  (1947), they comprise most of the
                  composition. Ruggles's use of canon appears to run
                  counter to his preference for freely mutating shapes
                  and his dislike of systematic devices. However,
                  Ruggles's canons always strike a balance between

  abstract =     {Theorists at least as far back as Tovey have noted a
                  number of movements by Schubert and Brahms that seem
                  anomalous, with respect both to the rest of their
                  works and to the way we generally understand the
                  formal conventions of the classical Viennese
                  instrumental music that constituted their horizon of
                  expectations. I submit that these pieces are
                  considered sui generis only because they have not
                  been analyzed in light of more flexible 18th-century
                  techniques for combining ritornello and binary
                  procedures, whether in rondos, in concerto forms, or
                  in concertante chamber music. This paper uses
                  Schenkerian analysis together with concepts drawn
                  from historical theory to reveal structural
                  similarities between ritornello forms by Haydn and
                  Mozart on the one hand, and Schubert and Brahms on
                  the other. The paper draws comparisons between
                  specific pieces (for instance, the finale of
                  Mozart's Sonata in C Minor, K. 457, and the first
                  movement of Brahms's Trio in C Minor, op. 101) not
                  for the purpose of claiming an empirically
                  verifiable instance of influence but rather to
                  demonstrate strikingly similar fusions of ritornello
                  and sonata principles. On a more general level, this
                  paper is intended as a contribution to Schenkerian
                  studies, specifically towards the application of the
                  theory not only to the analysis of individual pieces
                  but also to broader considerations of rhythm, style,
                  form, and genre.},

                  structure for the secular, polyphonic music of
                  Machaut.  Allowing for the possibility of multiple
                  tonal centers in individual works, it compares
                  structural sonorities across Machaut's output and
                  accounts for a matrix of relationships rather than
                  single categories for each piece. Proposing that
                  coherence and aesthetic value can arise through
                  layers of relationships, it provides a tool for
                  discerning larger patterns of structure and for
                  determining standard versus anomalous behavior in
                  individual songs. Closer readings of the texts of
                  three songs and the relationship between text and
                  large-scale structure demonstrate the application of
                  the theory.},

                  melodic contour structure in Olivier Messiaen's
                  mature birdsong. Following some key refinements to
                  Robert Morris's (1993) Contour-Reduction Algorithm
                  and prime contour classification system, the
                  algorithm is applied to various passages from
                  Messiaen's "RÃ©veil des Oiseaux" and birdsong
                  transcriptions in Tome V of his "TraitÃ© de Rythme,
                  de Couleur, et d'Ornithologie", thereby revealing
                  the existence of numerous nonretrogradable patterns,
                  varying in both nature and degree of exactitude, at
                  a deeper level of structure. The article then
                  discusses the specific features that these pattersn
                  exhibit, and explores some of the major issues
                  involved in carrying out an analysis of this
                  kind. Finally, evidence is offered in support of the
                  assertion that these contour symmetries represent a
                  concrete manifestation of Messiaen's self-admitted
                  tendency to unintentionally insert his own
                  compositional voice and artistic sensibilities into
                  his birdsong transcriptions.},

                  readings of music and text in songs by Wolf and
                  Schoenberg. The metaphor of energy enables in-time
                  interpretations of relations between rhythm and
                  meter, contour, intensification and
                  de-intensification in other domains, and the desire
                  of musical and poetic personae. The approach is also
                  grounded in recent theories of metaphor,
                  cross-domain mapping, and embodied
                  meaning. Analytical readings explore the dynamics of

                  crude way to convey a sense of
                  intensification. Certainly that is how many popular
                  composers have exploited the device, but this
                  article examines its various guises in four of Frank
                  Loesser's theatrical songs--"Adelaide's Lament,"
                  "Luck be a Lady," "How to Succeed," and "My Time of
                  Day"--demonstrating how the composer utilizes such
                  modulations to serve very different rhetorical
                  functions, portraying situational anxiety, gravity,
                  or whimsy. The article suggests that the ways in
                  which we structurally understand (and analyze)
                  direct modulation can be linked to its narrative
                  aim. Two analytical models will be introduced: one
                  represents a coloristic or purely dramatic tonal
                  ascent, while the other represents a more profound
                  sense of melodic ascent that reassigns scale-degree
                  function to a different pitch class. The four
                  analytical vignettes grow in length and complexity
                  over the course of this article, concluding with a
                  large-scale reading of the dramatic and tonal paths

                  meter, and metric superimposition. Their 2004 EP

                  intuitively appealing proposal that music engages
                  the listener by generating expectations that can be
                  fulfilled or avoided for aesthetic effect. Yet in
                  the intellectual climate then prevalent, the mind
                  was conceptualized as a black box. Given the changes
                  in intellectual milieu over the past half century,
                  including significant ventures into the mental black
                  box not only in cognitive science but also in music
                  theory, now seems a particularly suitable time for
                  picking up some of the strands of Meyer s visionary
                  theory of tendency and suggestion in music. This
                  paper aims to extend some of the hints he offers on
                  the mental phenomenon of expectation and to develop
                  them into explicit tools amenable to use in
                  analysis. This endeavor starts with a general
                  categorization of the experiential correlates of
                  musical tendency into types of listening ahead and
                  types of surprise.},

                  to explain irregular resolutions of seventh chords
                  because it requires that all harmonies be understood
                  in relation to a particular key.  Approaching these
                  resolutions instead based on voice-leading
                  transformations in which characteristic dissonances
                  in seventh chords (i.e., the tritone, augmented

                  transformation theory are proposed. First,
                  cross-type transformations transform one sort of
                  object to another: for instance, mappings from
                  triads to seventh chords. Special cases include GIS
                  homomorphisms and interscalar transpositions and
                  inversions. The second extension relaxes Lewin's
                  requirement that the products of transformations
                  along two paths from one node to another in a
                  transformation graph must match. It is argued that
                  this path consistency condition is unnecessarily
                  restrictive; several alternatives are
                  considered. Examples from Bach to Bartok illustrate
                  musical relationships that can be most effectively
                  modeled through the use of cross-type
                  transformations and non-path-consistent graphs.},

  abstract =     {While most internationally known Indian musicians
                  have ventured into fusion, many have felt
                  limitations, for indigenous musical values and
                  principles tend to be altered or ignored in spirit
                  of collaboration. Chitravina N.  Ravikiran has
                  proposed a concept called melharmony to help guide
                  the use of harmony in South Indian classical music.
                  Melharmony suggests that voice leading should be
                  derived from the melodic and combinational structure
                  of the raga.  To this end, we study ragas to reveal
                  the harmonic potential of their melodic
                  structure. We consider the combinational potential
                  of ragas and their scales, their networks of pitch
                  classes, their hierarchy of salient tones, and the
                  chords derivable from them.},

                  interaction that articulates what the music does to
                  or for someone (e.g., that it confuses, astonishes,
                  or moves a listener), and how it does so. To connect
                  analysis to musical sensibility, I reframe it as
                  interpretation in the everyday sense in which things
                  are "open to interpretation," or in which an
                  interpretation is an account of something that might
                  be taken in a number of ways. I draw together four
                  ideas under this umbrella; analysis as: (1) a
                  meeting between an individual and some music; (2) a
                  characteristic expression of its author; (3)
                  experiences with music; and (4) conceptual and
                  verbal invention. What I advocate might also be
                  called a humanistic psychology of music.},

  abstract =     {Of all composers of the common-practice era, perhaps
                  none has been associated with musical ambiguity more
                  than Brahms. Several recent essays nevertheless
                  question the usefulness of ambiguity as an
                  analytical concept. This article defends the
                  efficacy of ambiguity through analysis of metrically
                  and harmonically bivalent passages from the
                  composer's C-minor Piano Quartet, Double Concerto,
                  Clarinet Trio, G-major String Quintet, and B-minor
                  Rhapsody. The analyses proceed from contradictory
                  readings of opening materials to later statements
                  that develop precisely those characteristics that
                  give rise to the initial double meaning. In each
                  case, the result is an enormous tonal delay whose
                  resolution corresponds with liquidation of the
                  contradictory characteristics, as the movements
                  finally achieve the clarity absent from their
                  ambiguous openings.},

                  Haydn and Mozart, and a quasi-minuet movement by
                  Brahms, demonstrate five types of interaction
                  between the extended upbeat and hypermeter. The
                  analyses describe the evolving hypermetric structure
                  of the minuets' openings and the subsequent
                  development of this thematic material. The extended
                  upbeat emerges in these minuets as a key

                  expressive meaning and performance.},

                  Arezzo, is the earliest of several theorists who
                  indirectly associate the semitone with
                  cross-dressing, using a Vergilian citation about
                  Phrygian men. Taking this as a starting point, this
                  paper explores the gendered nature of sub-tonal
                  intervals. The femininity of the semitone is
                  initially a theoretical commonplace drawn from Greek
                  antiquity, but in the context of medieval
                  antifeminism on the one hand and the new placement
                  and tuning of semitones afforded by the directed
                  progression on the other, the ethical precariousness
                  of ars nova music leads a number of music theorists
                  to highly gendered and revealing discussions of
                  their own contemporary musical practices.  This
                  paper discusses the theoretical positions of

                  of the gendered discourse that surrounded intervals
                  smaller than a tone. It can be argued that
                  fourteenth-century counterpoint represents a point
                  of origin for music-theoretical associations between
                  chromaticism, exoticism, femininity and the sexually

                  Chromatic Music, questions the traditional mapping
                  of chords onto function, and instead suggests that
                  scale steps embody the source of harmonic
                  function. His reformulation creates a new one-to-one
                  mapping of scale steps onto harmonic function, which
                  may be, at times, problematic.  This article

                  different mechanism for the evaluation of harmonic
                  function based on the Tonnetz. It examines a
                  particular set of chromatic harmonies that display
                  plural function, which may be organized according to
                  a genus and species mode of classification.},

                  output, and serve a variety of functions. Debussy

                  finest and most progressive works, including the
                  Sonata for Violin and Piano, the Chansons
                  madÃ©casses, and the opera L'Enfant et les
                  sortilÃ¨ges. Many Ravel scholars have consistently
                  designated significant segments of these and other
                  late works as polytonal. While these works feature
                  dissonant superimposition, this paper proposes that
                  the passages in question may generally be construed
                  as representing one of two types: monotonal, wherein
                  the bass assimilates the upper-voice dissonances; or
                  a dual organization, which features a primary and
                  secondary pitch priority (in place of the term
                  "polytonality"). The conceptualization draws on
                  contemporary and historical accounts of polytonality
                  (including those of Milhaud and Ravel); the analyses
                  focus on compositional and structural factors and
                  contexts that prevent or potentially enable dual
                  organization to take place.},

                  in two movements from Debussy's orchestral Images:
                  "Gigues" and "Le matin d'un jour de fÃªte." The
                  analyses draw on recent studies of tonal pairing and
                  directional tonality in nineteenth-century music,
                  with particular focus on the concepts of "double
                  tonic complex" and "tonic sonority."  Debussy's
                  tonally directional frameworks are found to be
                  rooted in nineteenth-century precedent, with respect
                  to overall tonal plan and its reflection in deep
                  middleground voice leading. However, the
                  compositional realizations tend to subvert or
                  problematize such underlying models, specifically
                  with regard to their aspect of implicit
                  goal-orientation toward the concluding tonic. Above
                  all, these pieces exhibit an essentially dramatic
                  approach to tonal dualism, one in which tonal
                  pairings are played out through techniques of
                  infiltration and confrontation. This dramatic
                  conception also extends to the role of chromaticism,
                  both in its relation to the dualistic nature of its
                  diatonic context and, with respect to chromatic
                  tonicization, through exploitation of its potential
                  role as foil to the inherent dualism of the
                  directional process.},

                  twelve-tone music, even in cases where such symmetry

                  Schoenberg's statements on the subject suggests that

                  musical functions. An analysis of his 1933 setting

                  notable exceptions they have generally neglected the
                  topic of contrary chromatic progressions. This
                  article investigates and categorizes divergent
                  chromatic wedge progressions that exploit recurring
                  patterns of either even or odd intervals between
                  outer voices. Segments of varying length may be
                  extracted from these models and successively
                  transposed to form a complete descending chromatic
                  octave in the bass.  Numerous analyses of extended
                  wedge progressions are drawn primarily from the
                  mature works of Wagner and Tchaikovsky, two
                  composers particularly fond of this device.},

                  rather than a sequence of actors and their actions,
                  and offers a narrative analysis of Chopin's Fourth
                  Ballade. The analysis embraces both hermeneutic and
                  semiotic concerns by examining what this music means
                  and how it signifies that meaning, and proposes a
                  reading of the Fourth Ballade that situates it
                  intertextually. I begin with a discussion of mimetic
                  and diegetic properties of music and consider ways
                  in which Chopin's ballades signify time,
                  particularly the past tense often deemed crucial to
                  narrative forms. I then expand Edward T. Cone's
                  notion of apotheosis, showing how Chopin's larger
                  works depend upon an emotionally transformed
                  recapitulation of an interior theme that often
                  represents a desired emotional state. After applying
                  these theories of apotheosis and temporality to the
                  Fourth Ballade, I conclude with a discussion of
                  pastoral literary narratives and the ways they
                  elucidate the expressive logic of this work.},

  abstract =     {Much of the Beatles' originality stems from the
                  special way in which they handle blue notes. Blue
                  notes, by nature, are alienated from their harmonic
                  environment and have a dissonant relationship with
                  them, giving the blues and all its derivatives a
                  rough, angry character. Nevertheless, the hostility
                  of blue notes toward the surrounding world may be
                  mitigated-"domesticated"-through
                  consonantization. From this perspective, the present
                  paper explains the formation of several of the
                  harmonic idioms that shape the Beatles' style. In
                  broader terms, the paper attempts to uncover the
                  blues affinities in the Beatles' repertoire, even
                  when they are latent and expressed in ostensibly
                  non-blues details.  These affinities contribute to
                  the unity of the repertoire despite its diversity
                  and eclecticism.},

                  counterpoint to connect any two harmonies. Voice
                  leadings are evaluated by three criteria: (1)
                  uniformity: the extent to which the voices move by
                  the same interval distance and thus approach
                  traditional transposition; (2) balance: the extent
                  to which the voices move by the same index number
                  and thus approach traditional inversion; and (3)
                  smoothness: the extent to which the voices travel
                  the shortest possible distance. The most uniform,
                  most balanced, or smoothest way of moving from one
                  set to another in pitch-class space, or from one set
                  class to another in a proposed voice-leading space,
                  provides a standpoint from which to assess any
                  specific compositional realization in pitch space.},

                  nineteenth century through the co-agency of
                  enumerative combinatorial processes and the modular
                  arithmetic governing the system of 12 pitch classes,
                  and its early exponents were removed from the atonal
                  revolution of the early twentieth century.
                  Combinatorial space is explored through
                  considerations of geometric and algebraic
                  representations by Carl Friedrich Weitzmann and
                  Heinrich Vincent, followed by closer examination of
                  the writings of Anatole Loquin, Ernst Bacon, and
                  Walther Howard, who between 1871 and 1932
                  independently derived comprehensive inventories of
                  the unique pitch-class collections or
                  <tex-math>$T_{n}-equivalence$</tex-math>
                  classes. Loquin derived his inventory through the
                  number of combinations (subsets) of 11 elements,
                  which correlate to the figured-bass classes in
                  contemporary terminology; Bacon, through the
                  partitions of 12; and Howard, through partitions of
                  outer-intervals in subsets of 12. Selected writings
                  from the 1920s by Herbert Eimert, Erwin Stein, Alois
                  <tex-math>$H\acute{a}ba$</tex-math>, and Fritz
                  Heinrich Klein are examined. These authors engage
                  the same statistical results and enumerative
                  processes as did Loquin, Bacon, and Howard, but
                  understand them as a gateway to the expansion of
                  harmonic resources of their time, not to further
                  theoretical abstraction into equivalence
                  classes. The article demonstrates that the
                  formulations of combinatorial space in these
                  nineteenth- and early twentieth-century writings
                  contributes to the conceptual preparation of the
                  pitch-class set and to a long tradition of
                  mathematical modeling in music theory.},

                  light of his theory of harmony, considering his
                  cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the
                  perspective of philosophical notions of
                  consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of
                  self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early
                  Romantics (F. Schlegel and Novalis) in their
                  critiques of linguistic representation,
                  temporality,and subject-object relations. The Early
                  Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the
                  subject fully within the fold of linguistic
                  representation, as does Weber, marking a key moment
                  in the history of the representation of listening by
                  music theory.},

                  breadth of application, and uses the theory to
                  explore phenomenal transformations of repetition in
                  music by Feldman, Haydn, Morris, and Bach. Two
                  contrasting Examples, from Morton Feldman's Crippled
                  Symmetry and the first movement of Joseph Haydn's
                  Piano Sonata No. 50 in C Major, introduce the
                  concept of recontextualization. After some
                  preliminary definitions, the theory defines two
                  basic concepts, ideas and instances, and three means
                  for recontextualization-changes in active contextual
                  criteria, segment boundaries, and structural
                  interpretation. Detailed analysis of excerpts from
                  Robert Morris's By Far (1995), a composition for

                  Klumpenhouwer network (K-net) can indeed
                  (essentially) be embedded in a "Perle-Lansky Cycle"
                  (or, simply, "Lansky Cycle"), a generalization of
                  the Perle cycles basic to Perle's theories of
                  Twelve-Tone Tonality. This enables the K-nets to be
                  transformed by certain spatial operations idiomatic
                  to the nature of Perle's cycles. On the other hand,
                  PL-cycles can be themselves regarded as certain
                  species of K-nets, and that enables their graphs to
                  be interrelated and organized, in certain contexts,
                  by operations of "isography," operations idiomatic
                  to K-net theory that are particularly well adapted

                  exploring in particular any recursive features of

                  theoretical topics, analytic observations are made

                  Lewin and Henry Klumpenhouwer have introduced the

                  transpositional and inversional relationships within
                  a single pitch-class collection. In constructing
                  their networks, Lewin and Klumpenhouwer have
                  proposed that an interval within each network
                  remains invariant while inversional relationships
                  change. There are, however, some relationships that
                  cannot be accounted for by conventional network
                  isography. Graphs may be musically and
                  orthographically connected and yet not fit one of

                  isography," wherein an inversional relationship is

  abstract =     {Chopin's interest in the music of Bach has long been
                  known, if perhaps underrated. Of particular
                  importance around the time Chopin arrived in Paris
                  (1829), the influence of Bach is most prominent in
                  his works of this period, especially the Etudes and
                  certain of the Preludes.  The present article begins
                  by considering the relationship of the baroque
                  "figural prelude" to the larger context of Baroque
                  keyboard and compositional pedagogy. After
                  demonstrating the structure of an improvised figural
                  prelude as described by C. P. E. Bach, and the
                  embodiment of this structural plan in J. S. Bach's
                  preludes, the paper continues by demonstrating
                  another potential source from which Chopin may have
                  drawn compositional models: the improvisation manual
                  of the early 19th century, in which the same
                  structural pattern survives, clothed in early
                  19th-century pianistic bravura. Thus the structural
                  resemblances to the Baroque prelude that this study
                  finds in Chopin's "Etudes" are hardly anachronistic,
                  although it seems clear that in the case of Chopin,
                  his study of Bach is the primary source. The paper
                  then reveals deep-level structural relationships
                  between Chopin's C-Major Etude op.  10, no. 1, and
                  Bach's C-Major Prelude (WTC 1), moving on as well to
                  another pairing of Chopin's C-minor Etude op. 25,
                  no. 12, and Bach's C-minor Prelude from WTC 1. The
                  study uses Schenkerian analysis as a means of making
                  clear statements about the evolution of musical
                  "style."},

  abstract =     {Contrary to conventional opinion, Schoenberg's
                  writings of 1911 and 1951 imply that he envisioned
                  "Klangfarbenmelodie" as a type of harmonic
                  progression. The term arose as Schoenberg imagined a
                  theory of atonal music along the lines of the
                  "Klang" model of tonality. Where the "Klang" tied a
                  chord's tones to the pitch of the fundamental,
                  "Klangfarbenmelodie" involved the possibility of
                  tones being sensed without reference to pitch. In
                  this light, two interpretations of Schoenberg's
                  early atonal music are proposed. The first treats a
                  tone's "Klangfarbe" as a sensation encompassing
                  pitch, making the music resemble phonetic
                  sounds. The second involves emergent timbres of
                  chords. Schoenberg's atonal harmonic designs often
                  promote the fusion of chords and the
                  imperceptibility of pitch within them.},

                  film-makers during Debussy's lifetime can provide
                  the basis for a model of continuity and succession
                  in this music and suggest some new ways of
                  approaching form in his late style. Cinema was of
                  considerable consequence in France during Debussy's
                  mature career, and the technical devices of the
                  cinema constituted a markedly new way of
                  representing time and space. Very few of the films
                  from the late 1890s and early 1900s have survived,
                  but the extant film reviews and contemporary
                  criticism provide a vivid sense of the early cinema,
                  its reception, and its characteristic devices.
                  Particular cinematic editing techniques are noted as
                  models for Debussy's own characteristic repertoire

                  progression was first clearly articulated by
                  Rameau. Yet in his TraitÃ©, this concept is still
                  demonstrably linked (via Zarlino) with an older
                  notion of harmonic progression: the late-medieval
                  contrapuntal doctrine that "imperfect" dyadic
                  sonorities "seek" or "require" resolution to
                  specific "perfect" dyads. This doctrine first
                  appears in Marchetto of Padua's Lucidarium
                  (1317/18). Its explanation, the general principle
                  that "the imperfect seeks its perfection," is a
                  scholastic formulation of a basic principle of
                  Aristotelian physics: natural motions are directed
                  toward a predetermined goal or "end" (telos), which
                  is the "perfection" of the moved thing. The
                  late-medieval application of this principle to
                  counterpoint thus emerges as the probable origin of
                  the concept of harmonic progression and, more
                  broadly, of the widely accepted view of music as
                  embodying "directed motion."},

                  Carnatic (South Indian classical) music. I focus on
                  one of Carnatic music's most widespread musical
                  forms: the kriti, a devotional song usually in three
                  major sections. Kritis often employ extensive use of
                  certain melodic/rhythmic variations called
                  sangatis. With the use of sangatis, the kriti
                  becomes a long, dynamic composition, often
                  containing a climax replete with intricate motivic
                  development. The focus of this paper is to study the
                  way in which the sangati phrases work to provide
                  long-range continuity and a sense of autogenetic
                  process within a kriti composition.  The analyses
                  are based on transcriptions made by the author of
                  recordings of the compositions "Karpagame," by
                  Papanasam Sivan, and of "Mokshamugaladha" by

                  centered on triadic relationships. Transformational
                  models for seventh chords have been proposed, but
                  without demonstration of their usefulness in the
                  analysis of complete musical structures. This study
                  focuses on half-diminished seventh chords
                  independently of their inversional relatives, the
                  dominant sevenths, and offers an analytic model that
                  is directly applicable to the nineteenth-century
                  repertoire. In late-Romantic practice,
                  half-diminished chords are adaptable to a variety of
                  extended harmonic functions, and they can also be
                  organized into three groups of four members each,

                  works where half-diminished chords appear with some
                  regularity, there are two tendencies that can be
                  observed with regard to their usage: first, the
                  proximate grouping of members of the same system,
                  and second, changes from one system to another
                  across larger spans in some systematic way. These
                  functional and transformational relationships are
                  illustrated in examples from the works of a diverse
                  group of composers, including Wagner, Richard
                  Strauss, DvoÅ™Ã¡k, Puccini, and Rachmaninov, and in

                  cross-partitions, or two-dimensional harmony and
                  voice leading formations, and examines the roles
                  they play in three "classical" twelve-tone
                  compositions. Part I lays the theoretical groundwork
                  for a partitional approach and focuses on a
                  variation in the third movement of Webern's
                  Concerto, op. 24. Part II offers a construct called
                  the trichordal complex and uses this construct to
                  analyze selected passages in Schoenberg's Piano
                  Concerto. Part III traces the development of
                  cross-partitions in the fourth of Dallapiccola's
                  frammenti di Saffo. The article advances new tools
                  for modeling twelve-tone music; suggests new ways of
                  hearing and conceptualizing these works; and shows
                  that it is both possible and profitable to talk
                  about harmony and voice leading in serial music.},

                  first entirely dodecaphonic composition provide new

                  essay focuses on sketches relating to the invention

                  Stravinsky's discovery of particular features and

                  reasons for the pivotal role played by the note
                  Eâ™­, and for the privileged status which accrues to

                  historical sketch traces significant precursors to
                  Schoenbergian dialectics by outlining key
                  developments in the history of dialectical thought
                  and adaptations of that thought within musical
                  discourse. The paper continues by formulating and
                  discussing various categories of opposition as they
                  are used in music theory in general and in
                  Schoenberg studies in particular. The next three
                  sections of the paper separate Schoenbergian
                  dialectics into three principal areas: Dialectics of

                  scale-building in world musics, drawing upon recent
                  interpretations of the modal system of the early
                  Tamil people of South India, as set forth in their
                  national epic, the CilappatikÄram (fifth century
                  C. E.?). The body of the paper consists of an
                  exposition of the Tamil modes, their generation,
                  tuning, rotation, and their pentatonic
                  derivatives. Among the distinctive features of the
                  Tamil system is the circular projection of the modes
                  along the twelve houses of the Zodiac, which allows
                  us to examine the unique nesting of 22, 12, 7, and 5
                  divisions of the octave and infer their
                  tuning. Further local color is provided by the
                  cultural connotations of the five principal modes,
                  which are mapped across a grid of five landscapes,
                  times of day, seasons of the year, phases of love,
                  sources of water, flowers, beasts, and the
                  like. Mode in music thus encapsulates all the
                  flavors and colors of Tamil civilization. The
                  article concludes with twelve observations on what

                  triad (1853) anticipates modern chromatic theory in
                  several concrete respects. Weitzmann's exploration
                  of semitonal voice-leading between augmented and
                  consonant triads leads him to suggest a
                  configuration of Klang-space that is complementary
                  to my hexatonic systems (1996). Douthett's Cube
                  Dance (1998) unites the two complementary
                  perspectives. Further parallels are noted between
                  Weitzmann's conception of augmented triad space (as
                  reflected in Liszt's Faust Symphony) and Boretz's

                  implicit, has long haunted the study of mensural
                  music. Is mensural rhythm, or is it not, subject to
                  regular rhythmic hierarchies? If it is, then what is
                  their nature? "Marking Mensural Time" aims to
                  resolve central aspects of this controversy by
                  clarifying certain of its conceptual underpinnings
                  and by introducing a fresh approach to the
                  discussion of mensural rhythm, grounded in the
                  concept of punctuality. On the basis of mensural
                  theory up to 1600, together with punctually oriented
                  analysis of five musical examples spanning this era,
                  it is argued that regular rhythmic hierarchies do
                  exist in mensural music, and that they are closely
                  related to, as well as significantly distinct from,
                  metrical hierarchies found in common-practice
                  music. In the course of discussion, the concept of
                  tactus, beginning with its first major articulation
                  by Adam of Fulda (1490), is also given fresh
                  examination, as a construct illustrating both the
                  connections and the distinctions between mensural
                  and common-practice conceptualizations.},

                  acknowledged his discovery and use of a
                  transformation that maps musical entities back and
                  forth between diatonic and chromatic modular
                  systems. But BartÃ³k's transformation need not be
                  limited to these; one can find examples of mappings
                  to and from other modular spaces in BartÃ³k's own
                  music. This article formalizes BartÃ³k's
                  transformation, as well as generalizes it to map
                  musical entities to and from any one of five
                  different spaces: chromatic (mod12), octatonic
                  (mod8), diatonic (mod7), whole-tone (mod6), and
                  pentatonic (mod5). The article then demonstrates
                  that the generalized operation is not linked to any
                  one compositional style in the twentieth century by
                  showing its use in works by Debussy, Stravinsky, and
                  Schoenberg. Finally, it defines a new equivalence
                  class, the modular set type, which groups together
                  those set classes that may be connected via the
                  generalized transformation, and uses the new
                  equivalence class and generalized transformation in
                  analyses of Webern's op. 5, no. 3 and Stravinsky's

		  structure and formal organization in three late Haydn
		  expositions (Symphony No. 96, I; String Quartet op. 74/3,
		  I; and String Quartet op. 76/2, I). It suggests that these
		  are not divided by a strong formal punctuation into two
		  parts--the first and the second groups--of which the latter
		  begins with the arrival of the secondary background Stufe,
		  V or III. Rather, the works postpone the arrival of this
		  harmony toward the end of the expositions, so that the form
		  is better described as continuous than as two-part.
		  Examination of works by Mozart and Beethoven shows,
		  however, many additional subtleties that inhibit strict
		  generalizations.},

                  occur with some frequency. These are normally

                  arrays or to the "constructions of twelve verticals"

                  four series forms from which twelve four-note chords
                  are created as vertical slices.  These four-part
                  arrays have interesting properties, including a
                  propensity to produce whole-tone harmonies, and
                  Stravinsky deploys them in structurally and
                  rhetorically significant ways.},

  abstract =     {The perpetual flow that marks J. S. Bach's
                  instrumental music is made possible, among other
                  things, by the friction produced by instances of
                  counterstress and by the consequent need to overcome
                  that friction in the course of the
                  piece. Counterstress is a rhythmic accent that
                  attaches to a weak beat or hyperbeat or
                  (cumulatively) to a weak measure; because it affects
                  the deeper levels of durational structure, its
                  dissipation often becomes a compositional strategy
                  that molds the long-range thematic and tonal
                  design. I present several examples of such strategic
                  dissipation at increasingly deep levels and over
                  increasingly long spans.},

  abstract =     {This paper studies networks of pitch-classes that
                  model voice-leading--the progression of pitches to
                  form horizontal "voices" or "lines." While tonal
                  voice-leading depends on distinctions between step
                  and leap, consonance and dissonance, chord-tone and
                  embellishment, voice-leading in post-tonal music
                  simply and nonnormatively describes the motions of
                  pitches, one to another. First, I stipulate some
                  limitations on totally free voice-leading and
                  construct a complete taxonomy of voice-leading
                  motions. Then I examine Richard Cohn's explicit
                  coupling of transformation and voice-leading of
                  major and minor triads as represented on Hugo
                  Riemann's tonnetz. The tonnetz is a traditional
                  example of what I have previously called a
                  compositional space; such spaces are out-of-time
                  networks of pcs that can underlie compositional or
                  improvisational action. After studying various
                  transformations of the tonnetz, voice-leading is
                  implemented by the use of another type of
                  compositional space, two-partition graphs. These
                  graphs are generalized so that pairs of pcsets
                  connected in the graph need not be disjoint nor form
                  members of only one set class. Any specified voice
                  motions can be stipulated. The result is a
                  collection of voice-leading spaces, a new category
                  of compositional space. Finally, I describe an
                  algorithm that allows one to construct voice-leading
                  spaces of any degree of complexity or closure.},

                  about the application of Schenkerian analysis to
                  jazz: (1) Is it appropriate to apply to improvised
                  music a method of analysis developed for the study
                  of composed music? (2) Can features of jazz harmony
                  (ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths) not appearing
                  in the music Schenker analyzed be accounted for by
                  Schenkerian analysis? and (3) Do improvising
                  musicians really intend to create the complex
                  structures shown in Schenkerian analyses? I argue
                  that these questions imply mistaken assumptions
                  about the content and origin of Schenker's theories,
                  the role of analysis, the function of dissonance in
                  common-practice harmony and in jazz, the nature of
                  improvisation as opposed to composition, and the
                  role of simplicity and complexity in popular and
                  classical music. While my answers qualify the
                  applicability of Schenker's theories to jazz, they
                  also emphasize the importance of models in creating,
                  explaining, and experiencing jazz.},

                  precisely conceptualized and analyzed since Walter
                  Piston first defined it. The new analytical
                  technique presented here attacks the central
                  problem--identifying the proper pitch simultaneities
                  whose duration patterns are at issue--by dissecting
                  the various properties of harmony into separate
                  comparative analyses: textural rhythm, phenomenal
                  harmonic rhythm, bass pitch, root/quality, density,
                  and function.  The resulting analysis provides a
                  new, detailed view of musical texture and, in
                  conjunction with two hypotheses, a means to
                  understand the dynamic tension of harmonic rhythm.},

                  matters of prolongation and closure in Liszt works

                  the tonic, either within the body of the work or at

                  these works and other kinds of tonally open
                  compositions in the Liszt repertoire builds upon
                  insights offered by recent scholars who have written

                  and Thomas McFarland. Liszt's works analyzed include

                  discovering and testing boundaries to the
                  applicability of the theory. Our â™¯IV/â™­V
                  Hypothesis is based on Schenkerian theory's
                  predictions that if â™¯IV/â™­V sonorities appear in
                  a tonal context, then they are always indirectly
                  related to the tonic; thus, whenever â™¯IV/â™­V

                  the tonic or are not explainable in a convincing way

                  music is almost alone in striving to be modern as
                  well as ancient--to be neoclassical. This article
                  works toward a theory of neoclassicism
                  indirectly--by concentrating on four pieces, each of
                  which exemplifies a different variety of engagement
                  between the modern composer and the past
                  model. Because its aims are broadly synthetic, the
                  chosen pieces have been much analyzed by others to
                  demonstrate how representative analyses can be
                  organized into a broader and less technical
                  understanding of neoclassicism. The paper suggests
                  how we might divest neoclassicism of some
                  equivocation by considering how and for what
                  purposes composers invoke the past by imitating an
                  older piece or style and the kinds of relation to
                  that past that such imitations suggest.},

                  chromatic quotations of diatonic tunes to determine
                  (1) how Ives altered his models intervallically, (2)
                  how these changes form linked diatonic areas within
                  quotations, and (3) how the diatonic orientations of
                  the original tunes are projected upon the

                  music remains a widely used basis for analyzing
                  atonal music, particularly that of Schoenberg. A
                  re-examination of Forte's premises questions whether
                  his method is suitable for the analysis of
                  Schoenberg's music. Schoenberg's manuscripts and
                  writings lack any evidence that Schoenberg
                  intentionally composed with pitch-class sets. In the
                  past, the practice of justifying analytical
                  observations by recourse to the composer's
                  intentions has led some to reject the findings,
                  invoking the intentional fallacy.  However, the
                  intentional fallacy has been hotly disputed and
                  should not be used to reject all uses of the
                  composer's intentions. Indeed, certain kinds of
                  statements not only permit but mandate consideration
                  of the composer's intentions. A close examination of
                  Forte's analysis of Schoenberg's op. 11 no. 1
                  reveals that his analysis fails the criterion of
                  testability. An alternative analytical approach is
                  proposed, one which is more in conformity with what
                  is known of Schoenberg's compositional thought from
                  the period.},

                  supports this concept, and additionally suggests

                  significant element in Classical music. The late
                  eighteenth-century symphonic movements examined tend
                  to unfold the aggregate in one of three ways: (1) as
                  a 5/7 cycle; (2) as a 1/11 cycle; or (3) as a more
                  ad hoc ordering derived from contextual motivic
                  processes. The most important thread throughout all
                  the analyses is the crucial role of the ordered
                  aggregate in each movement's formal structure and/or

                  from increasing awareness of each others'
                  discipline. However, it is necessary to delimit the
                  common ground shared by the disciplines and, at the
                  same time, to clarify basic differences between the
                  two approaches. Toward this end, this article begins
                  with a schematic history of the psychology of music
                  from the point of view of how it has been influenced
                  by music theory. Following this is a brief
                  characterization of the goals, methods, and
                  theoretical commitments of experimental
                  psychology. The article then reports a recent
                  program of research that reflects the direct
                  influence of music theory on psychological
                  experimentation. The experiments test predictions of
                  the bottom-up component of Eugene Narmour's 1990
                  implication-realization model for melodic
                  expectancy. It is shown that five principles
                  underlie this component leading to the development
                  of an experimentally testable, quantitative
                  formulation. The principles are validated across
                  three different musical styles and listeners varying
                  in music training and experience. Implications for
                  the psychological studies of music are discussed.},

                  style-historical investigation of the
                  eighteenth-century rondo. Schenker himself, despite
                  his innovations, too often follows traditional
                  nineteenth-century Formenlehre in narrowly equating
                  an individual genre with a particular formal
                  technique, even if historically the one did not
                  necessarily imply the other. The interrelationship
                  of form and genre is too complex to be ascribed to a
                  shared middle-ground paradigm.  Nevertheless,
                  Schenkerian theory allows a clearer picture to
                  emerge of the ways in which composers fused rondo
                  and ritornello characteristics with binary variants
                  of sonata form. Formal procedures previously
                  considered sui generis are actually fairly common
                  eighteenth-century treatments of the finale,
                  characteristic of composers like Vanhal and Steffan
                  as well as Mozart.},

                  Lassus's twenty-four famous duos. Three types of
                  contrapuntal events are identified in each piece:
                  time interval of imitation, fuga (type of melodic
                  variation), and "blocks" (contrapuntal combinations,
                  usually varied by transposition or invertible
                  counterpoint). Occurrences of these events are
                  mapped onto time lines for all twenty-four
                  pieces. The time lines suggest conclusions regarding
                  Lassus's normative formal procedures. These
                  procedures can in some cases be related to text and,
                  in others, taken as suggestions for expressive
                  performance.},

  abstract =     {This essay presents a rhythmic analytical theory for
                  Schoenberg's middle-period music. It represents
                  polyphony as concurrent "pulse streams" created by
                  regularly recurring accents, and shows how the
                  relations of synchrony that obtain among pulse
                  streams, motives, and textural voices create musical
                  form. The theory is used to analyze "Mondestrunken"
                  and "Columbine" from Pierrot lunaire. The analyses
                  correlate pulse-stream processes to the syntax of
                  the songs' texts, and reveal similarities of
                  rhythmic design in these pieces. They also
                  accommodate the contributions of some often
                  neglected musical dimensions, such as contour and
                  dynamics, to form.},

                  Mathis Lussy proposes that musical expression is
                  implicit in the musical surface and therefore that
                  sensitive performers respond to the same surface in
                  the same manner. Through an analysis of the opening
                  song of Schumann's Frauenliebe und -leben based on
                  Lussy's theory, this paper explores Lussy's
                  proposition. Following the analysis, twelve
                  recordings of this song made over the past 45 years
                  are compared. Lussy's proposition is correct with
                  respect to variations of tempo.  However, this same
                  comparison reveals that two very different
                  interpretive models of this song exist when one
                  considers how these variations of tempo aid in the
                  projection of the formal structure. There would
                  appear to be a correlation between a "poetic" model
                  and recordings from the 1940s and 1950s, and between
                  a "prosaic" model and recordings from the 1970s.},

                  representational art-works such as novels derives
                  from imagining a world to which work and reader
                  together belong.  Though nonrepresentational, music
                  too arouses such a sense of involvement. This paper
                  proposes that analytical prose creates fictions
                  about involvement and that the existence and nature
                  of such fictions make a great deal of difference to
                  our construals of musical works. Examination of
                  extracts from several analytical texts identifies
                  issues involved in the creation of analytical
                  fictions and demonstrates that different authors,
                  engaging musical works in different ways, create
                  very different portrayals of involvement.},

                  basis for constructing it, and the means of
                  evaluating the success of its training. Reasons for
                  the frustrations generated by the gap between
                  current cognition research and its applications are
                  presented. The pervasive model of knowledge
                  acquisition, one rooted in objectivist theory, is
                  examined, and the limitations of the training
                  effected through this model are noted. A distinction
                  between well-structured and ill-structured content
                  domains is introduced. Next an alternate,
                  constructivist paradigm for training in
                  ill-structured domains is proposed, and its
                  advantages are cited. A further inconsistency in the
                  epistemological/procedural relationship is cited
                  regarding teaching of analysis vs. teaching aural
                  cognition. The article concludes with a call for a
                  broadening of the epistemological basis of all the
                  interrelated areas of aural training, instructional
                  design, and cognition research itself.},

                  the dramatic delineation of a parallel thematic
                  design. This essay explores the difficulties
                  Schenker encountered in the derivation of sonata
                  form from a single Ursatz and reveals that he was
                  anachronistically forcing the ideal of organic unity
                  onto the large-scale formal conventions of the
                  classical period.  However, these very difficulties
                  evaporate when his method of analysis is applied to
                  a number of Brahms's more unusual sonata
                  forms. Through an overlap of the retransition and
                  the beginning of the recapitulation and a
                  reinterpretation of the sonata principle, Brahms
                  achieved creatively the specific type of organic
                  unity Schenker had difficulty demonstrating in his
                  analyses of late-eighteenth-century music.},

                  the so-called "Schopenhauerian" ending, verses that
                  Wagner did not set to music because, in his opinion,

                  greatest precision in the effect of the
                  drama-sounding-in-music." The first part of this
                  essay reviews Wagner's changing attitude towards his
                  Nibelung project and considers the ending of
                  GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung in the light of the
                  "Schopenhauerian" verses. The second part examines

                  addresses the adequacy of the traditional

                  surface features in common with those of tonal
                  forms, yet his works are based on a fundamentally
                  different musical grammar.  This has led certain
                  analysts to conclude that there is a hiatus between
                  his music's language and its large-scale
                  structure. A closer reading suggests, however, that
                  Webern's forms derive in sensible ways from his
                  underlying pitch language, and that their
                  similarities to tonal forms arise from the fact that
                  both tonal and twelve-tone grammars permit similar
                  narrative strategies. This point is explored in
                  analyses of three movements that display
                  similarities to tonal binary and sonata-allegro
                  forms--the second movement of Op. 27, the first
                  movement of Op. 22, and the finale of Op. 20.},

  abstract =     {The paper begins with a brief review of previous
                  work on musical contour by Richard Bassein, Robert
                  Cogan, Pozzi Escot, Michael Friedmann, Paul Laprade,
                  Elizabeth Marvin, Robert Morris, Larry Polansky, and
                  James Tenney. To this end, Schoenberg's Piano Piece,
                  Op. 19 No. 4 is analyzed.  Its pc-set segmentations
                  are associated with relations among sets of
                  equivalent contours. The main part of the paper
                  introduces the contour reduction algorithm, based on
                  principles of perceptual organization from gestalt
                  psychology. The algorithm allows one to associate
                  nonadjacent contour pitches according to their
                  degree of salience. Any contour can be reduced to
                  one of a set of irreducible prime contours that
                  defines its characteristic depth. The algorithm is
                  applied to the six phrases of the Schoenberg piece
                  and the result resonates well with the previous
                  contour/pc-set analysis. The hierarchic nature of
                  the algorithm also helps organize the many classes
                  of equivalent contours. Morris's definition of a
                  contour as the association of any two sets leads to
                  the construction of a taxonomy including all
                  possible contours. Contours that include replication
                  and simultaneities are defined by various categories
                  in mathematical relation theory. The paper includes
                  a discussion of the role of salience in musical
                  structure. The contour reduction algorithm is
                  compared to familiar reductive methodologies of
                  tonal music and the perceptual gestalt theories of
                  Tenney and Polansky.},

                  musical form by rejecting nineteenth-century tonal
                  and formal practice. This essay considers this claim
                  by examining the tonal and thematic framework of the
                  PrÃ©lude Ã "L'AprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune." Although this
                  analysis shows that the PrÃ©lude can be explained by
                  traditional tonal procedures, it identifies four
                  techniques--incomplete progressions, parenthetical
                  episodes, motivic compression, and tonal
                  models--that allowed Debussy to move away from
                  conventional symphonic models. The paper ends by
                  showing how he developed these techniques in later
                  orchestral works such as the Nocturnes, La Mer, and

                  ancient Indian musicians make their way from a
                  "chromatic" universe of 22 microtonal divisions of
                  the octave (the Å›rutis) to a "diatonic" set of
                  seven degrees? and (2) What features do the
                  resulting scale structures have in common with later
                  versions of the diatonic scale in the West? The
                  authors examine the selection principles that appear
                  to have guided these musicians, and explore some of
                  the remarkable features and implications of their
                  solutions. The two basic early Indian heptatonic
                  scales (sa-grÄma and ma-grÄma) share a
                  number of features with the Western diatonic scale:
                  (1) distinct step sizes which are consecutive
                  integers, (2) dual tetrachords, (3) exactly one
                  tritone, (4) distinct sizes of fifths which are
                  consecutive integers, (5) a maximal number of
                  consonant fifths (consistent with feature 4), and
                  (6) first- or second-order maximal evenness (as
                  defined by Clough and Douthett). There are three
                  smaller feature sets, each including two or three of
                  the above features, that serve to define both the
                  early Indian heptatonics and the Western diatonic:
                  given the appropriate chromatic cardinality (22 or
                  12), each feature set corresponds either (a) to all
                  and only the heptatonics specified in the early
                  Indian treatises plus two permissible altered
                  versions or (b) uniquely to the Western diatonic.},

                  Schubert's experiments with sonata
                  form--particularly his fondness for beginning the
                  recapitulation in the subdominant--might affect
                  interpretation of deep-level structure from a
                  Schenkerian perspective. To explain Schenker's views
                  and to place the discussion in a larger theoretical
                  context, the author first considers the important
                  distinction between aspects of musical design and
                  tonal structure in general and then as it relates to
                  our understanding of sonata form. Schenker
                  considered sonata form an outgrowth of a two-part
                  division of the structure, but the author prefers to
                  view form as an aspect of design separate from the
                  structure, and he contends that deviations from the
                  classical norm, as exemplified by some of Schubert's
                  music, are best understood with this distinction in
                  mind.},

                  foreground, middleground, and background. It appears

                  variation are similar. The article systematically
                  extends remarks that Schoenberg made in a radio
                  lecture on the Four Orchestral Songs, Op. 22. An
                  analysis of the first stanza of "Seraphita" Op. 22
                  No. 1 shows that two considerations motivate the

                  the motivic source: Schoenberg's obligations to

                  Theory is discussed from the point of view of
                  historical method and underlying
                  motivation. Although he casts his history of
                  harmonic theory as a developmental history, Riemann
                  is shown to have constructed a discovery history, in
                  which a set of unchanging natural truths about
                  harmonic logic are gradually discovered by
                  generations of theorists who are understood to be
                  asking the same questions. Riemann's methodology as
                  a historian of theory is seen as embodying the same
                  taxonomic impulse that informs his theoretical
                  work. There follows an investigation of the claims
                  of natural science, idealist thought, and
                  nationalist pride on Riemann's motivation for
                  writing his history of harmonic theory.},

                  types of relations: 1) relations of elements in
                  tonal space, the nontemporal mental structure
                  through which we process tonal music; 2) relations
                  of these tonal elements in event space, the
                  temporally ordered space of actual music; and 3)
                  relations of motivic association. The distinction of
                  paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations, as developed
                  by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure,
                  provides a striking parallel to the concepts of
                  tonal space and event space in tonal theory. Further
                  elaboration of the syntagmatic/paradigmatic axis by
                  the structuralist critics who followed Saussure
                  offers a similar parallel to motivic relations in
                  music. The present article probes the ramifications
                  of these parallels and argues that they can
                  illuminate certain problematic areas of analysis,
                  notably that of chromaticism in the music of the
                  later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.},

                  nonbeat-based rhythms as "rhythmic contours" of
                  relative longs and shorts, drawing upon discussions
                  of temporal spaces appearing in recent work of
                  Robert Morris and David Lewin and upon various
                  music-psychological investigations of rhythmic
                  perception. A new type of temporal space is
                  proposed: a duration space (d-space) analogous to
                  Morris's contour space, in which elements are
                  ordered sequentially from short to long. After
                  developing equivalence relations for d-space
                  segments, illustrated by excerpts from Edgard
                  VarÃ¨se's Octandre, the paper concludes with an
                  analysis of Density 21.5 that focuses upon

                  have a critical side: by achieving familiar ends
                  through novel means, Ives seeks to demonstrate the
                  artificiality of accepted conventions. In his early
                  experiments, Ives critiques tonality and its basic
                  concepts, including tonic-dominant polarity,
                  prolongation, tertial chords, and cadences. These
                  pieces use polytonality, whole-tone fields,
                  symmetrical chords, and other post-tonal techniques,

                  understandings of musical rhetoric, offering in
                  their place a conception of rhetoric rooted in the
                  classical model of rhetoric as persuasive
                  discourse. Fugue in general is studied in light of
                  its affinity to this model. The fugue to Bach's
                  Toccata, S. 915, is then closely analyzed as
                  rhetorical discourse. The notion of rhetorical
                  status, or issue, is brought to bear upon the
                  subject of the fugue, which exposes the
                  compositional problems that the fugue addresses with
                  specific "arguments." The article concludes with

                  interval patterns and particular intervallic
                  combinations often serve as primary structural
                  forces. Particularly prevalent are cyclic
                  intervallic repetitions, reflecting compositional
                  concerns for coherence through repetition and
                  pitch-class variety. Ives experiments both with the
                  familiar interval cycles and with cycles of two
                  alternating intervals, or "combination cycles."
                  Musical usages include straightforward cyclic
                  presentations as well as developments of cyclically
                  generated structural frameworks.  In his most
                  sophisticated cyclic experiments, including In re
                  con moto et al, On the Antipodes, and the Universe
                  Symphony, cycles and cyclic principles are central
                  to the musical and metaphorical substance, mirroring
                  pervasive elements of Ives's attitudes toward art
                  and nature.},

                  same underlying structure, that of the well-formed
                  scale.  Well-formedness is defined in terms of a
                  relationship between the order in which a single
                  interval generates the elements of a pitch-class set
                  and the order in which those elements appear in a
                  scale. Another characterization provides a recursive
                  procedure for organizing all well-formed scales into
                  hierarchies. Finally, well-formed scales are defined
                  in terms of scale-step measure, and aspects of the
                  diatonic set are examined.},
