  review        = {In this remarkable book, Antony Hopkins shows how the
                  entire orchestra acts as a distinct musical instrument, one
                  which composers have played upon over the centuries to
                  express every mood, from the most sublime to the most
                  frivolous. In so doing, he explains the ways in which a
                  composer's "signature in sound" develops, from the subtly
                  exotic pattern of a Bartok theme to the sensuously
                  evocative chords in Debussy. Hopkins offers an in-depth
                  look at the origins of the orchestra itself, an
                  evolutionary process that took the better part of two
                  centuries in Europe, yet finds its roots in our ancient
                  past. He begins his discussion in ancient Egypt, Greece,
                  and Rome, moves through the music of medieval Europe, and
                  ultimately reaches a watershed moment in the history of the
                  orchestra as we now know it: the composition of Bach's
                  Brandenburg Concertos in the early eighteenth century.
                  Having introduced the various instruments, explained the
                  development of their groupings, and demonstrated how the
                  blending of their tones led to the orchestral sounds of the
                  modern era, he provides an incisive examination of actual
                  compositions. Expertly guiding readers through
                  representative pieces by Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz,
                  Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Britten, Hopkins offers a unique
                  and insightful companion for beginning and more seasoned
                  concert-goers alike.}
