		  of the change in one musical parameter as a function of
		  another. In my dissertation, contour theories proposed by
		  Robert Morris, Michael Friedmann, Elizabeth Marvin, Paul
		  Laprade, Ian Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky
		  and Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these authors
		  approach changes in pitch as a function of time. A
		  commonality between these theories was shown to be the use
		  of a system of pitch level identification based on the
		  relative highness or lowness of the pitches, not based on
		  actual pitch frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody.
		  Additionally, these theories did not account for rhythmic
		  or durational elements of the pitches as they are
		  articulated in time. Music perception studies were cited
		  that indicated that contour can play an important role in
		  the recognition and memory of a melody, and that pitch
		  interval and rhythmic components are vital elements in
		  music understanding. Because these contour theories lacked
		  the important musical elements of pitch and rhythm, an
		  analytical method for the study of musical contour that
		  incorporates both of these in its model of a melody is
		  developed. This analytical method uses the mathematical
		  technique of multiple linear regression to develop a model
		  of the melody that can be graphed as representative of the
		  contour of the actual melody. This method was used to
		  analyze the first themes from the first movements of the
		  nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using regression
		  modeling, the sonata melodies were categorized into two
		  melody types: Type MD and Type LB. Analytical methods
		  proposed by other theorists were then used to analyze
		  selected melodies, and a comparison between the multiple
		  linear regression model and these results was made.},

  abstract = {This dissertation takes work on contour by Robert Morris
                  as a point of departure and develops a set of
                  contour reduction algorithms, called "window
                  algorithms." These involve the notion of a
                  hypothetical window or frame of a specific width
                  (i.e. number of events) through which the contour
                  succession in a given melody is experienced
                  temporally (much like the way a landscape is
                  experienced visually through the side window of a
                  moving automobile or train. Certain normative
                  principles relevant to windows of various widths are
                  devised and represented with the help of symbolic
                  logic and flowcharts. Reiterative application of the
                  window algorithms on a melody to "prune" pitches at
                  a series of successive levels, introduces notions of
                  melodic contour hierarchy that are explored in
                  various ways throughout the dissertation. The
                  application of the algorithms is demonstrated on a
                  variety of 20th century musical excerpts reflecting
                  a wide range of melodic archetypes, thereby enabling
                  observation of the behavior of the algorithms in
                  different musical contexts. Phenomenological and
                  cognitive implications of the algorithms are
                  discussed from the perspective of a listener
                  implementing the algorithm on the fly. An analysis
                  focusing on the Hauptstimmen in the first movement
                  of Schoenberg’s Third String Quartet explores how
                  intervallic features of the reduced contours can
                  form the basis for a tonal-formal reading of the
                  movement. The possibility of extending the theory to
                  the duration domain is also introduced; following a
                  preliminary analysis involving instrumental gestures
                  from the opening of Webern’s Variations for
                  Orchestra, and a discussion of analytical,
                  conceptual, and methodological inconsistencies
                  arising from the application of the algorithms on
                  duration contours, an alternative approach that
                  attaches appropriate durations to (reduced) pitch
                  contours is developed, examined, and advocated. The
                  relationships and interactions between the pitch and
                  duration contours in Berio’s Sequenza I are examined
                  in the light of the proposed theory.}

  abstract	= {Contour is a generalization of melodic direction (in
		  particular, ascending and descending motion), but it is not
		  routinely considered a primary delineator of structure in
		  most tonal music. A melody in a common-practice work might
		  leap to a high register and then suddenly reverse itself at
		  a particularly crucial moment. Although this melody
		  interacts with other musical events, one would probably
		  interpret its contour as a contributor to--but not a
		  primary delineator of--musical structure. But contour
		  possesses an increased potential to create structural
		  associations in post-tonal music (specifically atonal or
		  motivic music), where the melodic and harmonic progressions
		  of tonal music are absent. Contour relations are analyzed
		  in a group of atonal works by Webern: Sechs Bagatellen, op.
		  9; Drei kleine Stücke, op. 11; the Fünf Orchesterstücke,
		  op. 10; and the Orchesterstücke (1913). These works lack
		  certain types of pitch organization, such as overt tonal
		  references and 12-tone techniques, which often account for
		  structural associations. In the absence of these systems of
		  pitch organization, contour becomes a significiant
		  structural factor on the melodic level and in larger
		  expanses of music. The melodic properties most important to
		  the formation of contour are identified. Selected contour
		  definitions are reviewed. Four interpretive assumptions by
		  which contour can be evaluated are proposed, and four
		  analyses of contour relations in complete works (one
		  movement from each opus) are discussed. Various
		  associational and transformational relations between
		  melodic contour, a medial level of structure labeled
		  textural contour, and the contour of the entire piece are
		  examined.},

                  literatures, eight competing notions of melodic
                  accent are identified. All eight conceptions of
                  melodic accent were investigated through
                  correlational studies of three contrasting samples
                  of music. Statistical correlations were calculated
                  for each accent type with respect to the
                  corresponding metric position or with respecto to
                  the syllabic/melismatic status of associated sung
                  text. The results for all three studies are most
                  consistent with a perceptual model of melodic accent
                  developed by Joseph thomassen (1982). The remaining
                  conceptions of melodic accent receibe little or no
                  empirical support. In addition, this study reveals
                  an endemic use of text-melody displacement on a
                  sample of Gregorian chant---suggesting that the
                  chant melodies were constructed so as to avoid

  abstract  = {This dissertation proposes the thesis that abstract
                  theories of pitch- and set-class structure do not
                  reflect listeners' aural perception of sounding
                  music as effectively as theories modelling the
                  articulation of these underlying structures on the
                  musical surface. This position is supported by a
                  review of pertinent music-theoretical and
                  music-psychological research. Based upon the data
                  collected by various music-psychologists, published
                  elsewhere but compared and critiqued here, this
                  study concludes that listeners generally use figural
                  cues drawn from musical context --- for example,
                  melodic shapes, changes of direction, relative
                  durationnal patterns, and so on --- to retain and
                  recognize musical ideas in short-term memory. These
                  figural cues may be represented in precise notation
                  and compared with one another by application and
                  generalization of Robert Morris's contour
                  theories. Morris's comparison matrix and contour
                  equivalence relations are introduced here, followed
                  by this author's generalization of the thwory to
                  duration space and development of similarity
                  relations for melodic contours of relative pitch
                  height and rhythmic contours of relative suration
                  successions. The similarity relations for musical
                  contours build upon previous wort of Dabid Lewin,
                  Robert Morris, and John Rahn. While the efficacy of
                  these theories for modelling perceivable patterns in
                  musical contexts cannot be proven without further
                  psychological testing, their applicability to
                  musical analysis is demonstrated. Analyses drawn
                  form the music of Bartok, Webern, Berg, and Varèse
                  illustrate ways in which melodic and rhythmic
                  contour relationships may be used to shape a formal
                  scheme to differentiate melody from accompaniment,
                  to associate musical ideas that belong to different
                  set classes, and to create unity throuth varied
                  repetition.  The concluding chapter explores avenues
                  for future work. A section on music-psychological
                  experimentation offers a critical overview of
                  research in this area and proposes ideas for future
                  experimentation. Second, the implications of
                  music-psychological research for the pedagogy of
                  non-tonal music theory are considered and a model
                  curriculum for non-tonal music theory proposed. The
                  dissertation concludes by proposing a number of ways
                  in which contour theory might be generalized to
                  other domains and illustrates the application of one
                  such generalization to the analysis of chord spacing
                  in a piano work of Luigi Dallapiccola.},

		  nonadjacent contour pitches according to their degree of
		  salience. Any contour can be reduced to one of a set of
		  irreducible prime contours that defines its characteristit
		  depth. The algorithm is applied to the six phrases of the
		  Schoenberg piece and the result resonates well with the
		  previous contouripc-set analysis. The hierarchic nature of

		  various categories in mathematical relation theory. The

                  approaches of Friedmann (1985) and Marvin and

                  of the contours, through the presence of cyclical
                  information (assessed via Fourier analysis) and the

                  predictions for contour similarity generated by
                  these models were examined for 20th century,
                  nontonal melodies (Experiment 1) and simplistic,

  abstract =     {Although the relatively recent proliferation of
                  research into musical contour theory has indeed
                  yielded a plethora of vital analytical and
                  methodological insights, a crucial phenomenological
                  problem remains to be fully addressed: its implicit
                  reliance upon a synchronous analytical perspective
                  whereby a contour’s constituent elements, though
                  ordered in time, are in fact interpreted as fully
                  and simultaneously present entities. The musical
                  processes that these contours describe, however,
                  obviously do not present themselves in this
                  manner—their constituent elements occur in direct
                  succession, not simultaneously. Such contours,
                  therefore, cannot be regarded as truly autonomous
                  musical objects; rather, they represent but a single
                  link—albeit the crucial, culminating link—in a
                  cumulative transformational chain of contours that
                  unfolds diachronically. The contour <1023>, for
                  instance, begins as the singleton <0>, and evolves
                  successively into <10> (its first two elements) and
                  <102> (its first three elements) before coming to
                  exist as such.  This dissertation develops a system
                  of contour relations that is fully contingent upon
                  this implicit process. Chapter One introduces and
                  develops the basic principles involved in such an
                  approach, which is centered around the construction
                  of a universal contour tree diagram that provides
                  the foundation for relating contours based on the
                  similarity of their diachronic-transformational
                  histories. Chapter Two provides a more comprehensive
                  account of the contour transformational process by
                  incorporating C-Pitch Adjacency Subsets (C-PAS) into
                  the system. This necessitates the development of
                  contour relationship “networks” and the subsequent
                  organization of them into their own hierarchy of
                  relationship types. In Chapter Three, these
                  principles are applied to the multi-level structural
                  space generated by Robert Morris’s (1993)
                  Contour-Reduction Algorithm, which not only extends
                  their utility beyond the strictly foreground level,
                  but also reveals some striking new principles and
                  systems of relations. Chapter Four demonstrates the
                  efficacy and novelty of the
                  diachronic-transformational approach through the
                  analysis of musical excerpts from works by
                  Beethoven, Berg, Webern, Messiaen, and
                  Holland-Dozier-Holland. Finally, Chapter Five offers
                  some concluding remarks and explores the potential
                  for future research using this methodology.}

                  relative magnitude is less pronounced. Only in the
                  case of clearly diverging relative magnitudes the
                  largest interval is the most powerful, particularly
                  when the intervals are in the same direction. The
                  advantage of rises over falls is almost
                  negligible. The short-term influence of physical
                  factors on momentary accent perception allows for a
                  description in terms of a "memory window" sliding
                  along the tone sequence. At each moment the
                  frequencies within the window provide the physical
                  cue for accent that has to be matched agains
                  anticipation. If the span of the window is minimal,
                  i.e., three tones, accent perception in sequences of
                  four tones, embedded according to the method of
                  controlled anticipation, has been accounted for
                  fairly well, the correlation coefficient between
                  predictions and outcomes being 0.76.},
