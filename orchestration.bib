  author	= {Antony Hopkins},
  review	= {In this remarkable book, Antony Hopkins shows how the
		  entire orchestra acts as a distinct musical instrument, one
		  which composers have played upon over the centuries to
		  express every mood, from the most sublime to the most
		  frivolous. In so doing, he explains the ways in which a
		  composer's "signature in sound" develops, from the subtly
		  exotic pattern of a Bartok theme to the sensuously
		  evocative chords in Debussy. Hopkins offers an in-depth
		  look at the origins of the orchestra itself, an
		  evolutionary process that took the better part of two
		  centuries in Europe, yet finds its roots in our ancient
		  past. He begins his discussion in ancient Egypt, Greece,
		  and Rome, moves through the music of medieval Europe, and
		  ultimately reaches a watershed moment in the history of the
		  orchestra as we now know it: the composition of Bach's
		  Brandenburg Concertos in the early eighteenth century.
		  Having introduced the various instruments, explained the
		  development of their groupings, and demonstrated how the
		  blending of their tones led to the orchestral sounds of the
		  modern era, he provides an incisive examination of actual
		  compositions. Expertly guiding readers through
		  representative pieces by Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz,
		  Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and Britten, Hopkins offers a unique
		  and insightful companion for beginning and more seasoned
		  concert-goers alike.}
