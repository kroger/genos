  abstract	= {Theories of musical contour can be described as the study
		  of the change in one musical parameter as a function of
		  another. In my dissertation, contour theories proposed by
		  Robert Morris, Michael Friedmann, Elizabeth Marvin, Paul
		  Laprade, Ian Quinn, Robert John Clifford, Larry Polansky
		  and Richard Bassein are reviewed. In general, these authors
		  approach changes in pitch as a function of time. A
		  commonality between these theories was shown to be the use
		  of a system of pitch level identification based on the
		  relative highness or lowness of the pitches, not based on
		  actual pitch frequencies or pitch intervals in the melody.
		  Additionally, these theories did not account for rhythmic
		  or durational elements of the pitches as they are
		  articulated in time. Music perception studies were cited
		  that indicated that contour can play an important role in
		  the recognition and memory of a melody, and that pitch
		  interval and rhythmic components are vital elements in
		  music understanding. Because these contour theories lacked
		  the important musical elements of pitch and rhythm, an
		  analytical method for the study of musical contour that
		  incorporates both of these in its model of a melody is
		  developed. This analytical method uses the mathematical
		  technique of multiple linear regression to develop a model
		  of the melody that can be graphed as representative of the
		  contour of the actual melody. This method was used to
		  analyze the first themes from the first movements of the
		  nineteen piano sonatas composed by Mozart. Using regression
		  modeling, the sonata melodies were categorized into two
		  melody types: Type MD and Type LB. Analytical methods
		  proposed by other theorists were then used to analyze
		  selected melodies, and a comparison between the multiple
		  linear regression model and these results was made.},

  title		= {Contour as a structural element in selected pre-serial

  school	= {University of Wisconsin-Madison},
  year		= {1995},
  abstract	= {Contour is a generalization of melodic direction (in
		  particular, ascending and descending motion), but it is not
		  routinely considered a primary delineator of structure in
		  most tonal music. A melody in a common-practice work might
		  leap to a high register and then suddenly reverse itself at
		  a particularly crucial moment. Although this melody
		  interacts with other musical events, one would probably
		  interpret its contour as a contributor to--but not a
		  primary delineator of--musical structure. But contour
		  possesses an increased potential to create structural
		  associations in post-tonal music (specifically atonal or
		  motivic music), where the melodic and harmonic progressions
		  of tonal music are absent. Contour relations are analyzed
		  in a group of atonal works by Webern: Sechs Bagatellen, op.
		  9; Drei kleine Stücke, op. 11; the Fünf Orchesterstücke,
		  op. 10; and the Orchesterstücke (1913). These works lack
		  certain types of pitch organization, such as overt tonal
		  references and 12-tone techniques, which often account for
		  structural associations. In the absence of these systems of
		  pitch organization, contour becomes a significiant
		  structural factor on the melodic level and in larger
		  expanses of music. The melodic properties most important to
		  the formation of contour are identified. Selected contour
		  definitions are reviewed. Four interpretive assumptions by
		  which contour can be evaluated are proposed, and four
		  analyses of contour relations in complete works (one
		  movement from each opus) are discussed. Various
		  associational and transformational relations between
		  melodic contour, a medial level of structure labeled
		  textural contour, and the contour of the entire piece are
		  examined.},

		  end. Schoenberg's Piano Piece, Op. 19 No. 4 is analyzed.
		  Its pc-set segmentations are associated with relations
		  among sets of equivalent contours. The main part of the
		  paper introduces the contour reduction algorithm, based on
		  principles of perceptual organization from gestalt
		  psychology. The algorithm allows one to associate
		  nonadjacent contour pitches according to their degree of
		  salience. Any contour can be reduced to one of a set of
		  irreducible prime contours that defines its characteristit
		  depth. The algorithm is applied to the six phrases of the
		  Schoenberg piece and the result resonates well with the
		  previous contouripc-set analysis. The hierarchic nature of
		  the algorithm also helps organize the many classes of
		  equivalent contours. Morris's definition of a contour as
		  the association of any two sets leads to the construction
		  of a taxonomy including all possible contours. Contours
		  that include replication and simultaneities are defined by
		  various categories in mathematical relation theory. The
		  paper includes a discussion of the role of salience in
		  musical structure. The contour reduction algorithm is
		  compared to familiar reductive methodologies of tonal music
		  and the perceptual gestalt theories of Tenney and

		  containing alterations which shift them a long distance
		  (harmonically) from the original should be considered
		  perceptually dissimilar relative to the original. It is
		  possible to obtain such a large shift with a small change
		  in melodic pitch. However, this creates a paradox with
		  pitch (contour) shifting, which is known to reduce
		  similarity minimally if the distance from the original is
		  small. We investigated the hypotheses that (1)
		  manipulations to contour and implied harmony of an original
		  melody reduce similarity scores and (2) novices are less
		  sensitive to implied harmony changes than experts, but as
		  sensitive as experts to contour manipulations. Twenty-eight
		  novices and 44 expert musicians rated similarity of
		  familiar nursery rhyme tunes compared with close and
		  distant harmonic transformations plus close and distant
		  pitch shifts. Results indicated that both groups use
		  contour (pitch distance) to determine similarity, but that
		  musically experienced listeners also use implied harmony to
		  make further distinctions. It is argued that as listeners
		  become more experienced, they rely on more sophisticated
		  strategies for encoding and organizing melodies in memory,
		  with deeper structural aspects of music being used when
		  other strategies such as contour are uninformative or
		  non-distinctive. These new findings, that contour and
		  harmony affect judged similarity for simple, familiar
		  melodies, have implications for theories of memory for
		  music, and for the design of automated music retrieval and

  abstract	= {This paper discusses an analysis of Jean-Claude Risset's
		  Contours , a tape work composed in 1982 using only computer
		  sound synthesis. The analysis is based on recorded traces
		  of the compositional process (Music code listings, verbal
		  and graphical annotations), and focuses on sound design
		  criteria. It attempts to elucidate the connection between
		  these criteria and the overall structure of the musical
		  work. In short, it investigates the observable link between
		  ''composing-the-sound'' and ''composing-with-sounds'' in
		  the making of Contours . The psychoacoustic relationship of
		  pitch to timbre is crucial, and was a primary concern in
		  all of Risset's operations in composing this work. In order
		  to let a particular pitch contour either dissolve, or
		  emerge from various timbral transformations, the composer
		  devised several ad hoc sound design strategies strictly
		  functional to the compositional concept. Further remarks
		  are proposed concerning a twofold aesthetic dimension
		  peculiar to this music: on the one hand, we have a legacy
		  to the French tradition of musical impressionism; on the
		  other, we have a more constructivist attitude, hidden
		  behind what at first may sound as a decorative interplay of
		  fascinating sound colors.},

  abstract	= {Este artigo tem por objetivo analisar uma peça para piano
		  de Ernst Widmer, Suave Mari Magno, op. 97. A partir de
		  dados biográficos essenciais do compositor e da gênese da
		  peça, a análise utiliza como ferramental teórico a pitch
		  class theory e a análise de contornos conforme Friedmann,
		  buscando fundamentação para a observação de aspectos de
		  coerência musical interna e das associações com a
		  ambiência marítima propiciadas pelo título, epígrafe e
		  comentários do compositor. A análise correlaciona a
		  lógica compositiva da peça com intenções
		  semântico-expressivas manifestadas por Widmer, trazendo à
		  tona processos composicionais diversificados e apontando a
		  convivência de técnicas tradicionais com gestos musicais
		  característicos do século XX.},
